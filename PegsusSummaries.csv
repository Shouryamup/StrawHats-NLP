"Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
Existing law establishes the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program, which receives 10% of the annual proceeds of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as a continuous appropriation, to fund capital improvements and operational investments to modernize California’s rail systems to achieve certain policy objectives, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, expanding and improving rail services to increase ridership, and improving rail safety. Existing law requires the Transportation Agency to evaluate applications for funding under the program and to prepare a list of projects recommended for funding, with grants to be awarded by the California Transportation Commission.
This bill would modify the purpose of the program to delete references to operational investments and instead provide for the funding of transformative capital improvements, as defined, that will modernize California’s intercity, commuter, and urban rail systems and bus and ferry transit systems to achieve certain policy objectives, including reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, expanding and improving transit services to increase ridership, and improving transit safety. By expanding the purposes for which continuously appropriated moneys may be used, the bill would make an appropriation. The bill would modify the information required to be included in applications for grants under the program and would authorize an eligible applicant to submit an application to fund a project over multiple fiscal years and to submit multiple applications. The bill would require the Transportation Agency, in selecting projects for funding, to consider the extent to which a project reduces greenhouse gas emissions, would add additional factors to be considered in evaluating applications for funding, and would expand certain factors considered to include bus and ferry transit service. The bill would require the Transportation Agency to approve, by July 1, 2018, a 5-year program of projects, and would require the California Transportation Commission to allocate funding to eligible applicants pursuant to the program of projects, with subsequent programs of projects to be approved not later than April 1 of each even-numbered year thereafter. The bill would require the Transportation Agency, in cooperation with the California Transportation Commission and at the request of an eligible applicant, to enter into and execute a multiyear funding agreement for a project to be funded over more than one fiscal year, as specified, and would authorize the California Transportation Commission to approve a letter of no prejudice that would allow an applicant to expend its own moneys on a project in the approved program of projects, subject to future reimbursement from program moneys for eligible expenditures.","This bill amends the Public Resources Code, with respect to the California Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program, to revise requirements for eligible projects under the program to include: (1) rail capital projects, including acquisition of rail cars and locomotives that expand, enhance, and improve existing rail systems and connectivity to existing and future transit systems, including the high-speed rail system; (2) intercity, commuter, and urban rail projects that increase service levels, improve reliability, or decrease travel times, including infrastructure access payments to host railroads in lieu of capital investments; (3) rail, bus, and ferry integration implementation, including integrated ticketing and scheduling systems, shared-use corridors, related planning efforts, and other service integration initiatives; and (4) implementing low carbon transit and other bus and ferry transit investments to increase ridership and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

"Existing law defines a request regarding resuscitative measures as a written document, signed by an individual with capacity, or a legally recognized health care decisionmaker, and the individual’s physician, directing a health care provider regarding resuscitative measures. Existing law defines a Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment form, which is commonly referred to as a POLST form, and provides that a request regarding resuscitative measures includes a POLST form. Existing law requires that a POLST form and the medical intervention and procedures offered by the form be explained by a health care provider. Existing law distinguishes a request regarding resuscitative measures from an advance health care directive.
This bill would enact the California POLST eRegistry Pilot Act. The bill would require the Emergency Medical Services Authority to establish a pilot project, in consultation with stakeholders, to operate an electronic registry system on a pilot basis, to be known as the California POLST eRegistry Pilot, for the purpose of collecting POLST information received from a physician or physician’s designee. The bill would require the authority to coordinate the POLST eRegistry Pilot, which would be operated by health information exchange networks, by an independent contractor, or by a combination thereof. The bill would require the authority to implement these provisions only after it determines that sufficient nonstate funds are available for development of the POLST eRegistry Pilot, any related startup costs, and an evaluation of the POLST eRegistry Pilot. When the POLST eRegistry Pilot is operable in the geographic area in which he or she operates or practices, a physician or physician’s designee who completes POLST information would be required to include the POLST information in the patient’s official medical record and would be required to submit a copy of the form to, or to enter the information into, the POLST eRegistry Pilot, unless a patient or his or her health care decisionmaker chooses not to participate in the POLST eRegistry Pilot. The bill would require the authority to adopt guidelines for, among other things, the operation of the POLST eRegistry Pilot, including the means by which POLST information would be submitted electronically, modified, or withdrawn, the appropriate and timely methods for dissemination of POLST form information, the procedures for verifying the identity of an authorized user, and rules for maintaining the confidentiality of POLST information received by the POLST eRegistry Pilot. The bill would require that any disclosure of POLST information in the POLST eRegistry Pilot be made in accordance with applicable state and federal privacy and security laws and regulations. The bill would provide immunity from criminal prosecution, civil liability, discipline for unprofessional conduct, and any other sanction for a health care provider who honors a patient’s request regarding resuscitative measures obtained from the POLST eRegistry Pilot, as specified. The bill would require an independent contractor approved by the authority to conduct an evaluation of the POLST eRegistry Pilot. The provisions of the bill would be operative until January 1, 2020.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on March 19, 2003.

Directs the Authority to adopt guidelines necessary for the operation of the Pilot, which shall include: (1) the means by which initial or subsequent POLST information may be submitted to, or withdrawn from, the Pilot; (2) appropriate and timely methods for electronic delivery of such information and the use of legally sufficient electronic signatures; (3) procedures for verifying the identity of"
"The Political Reform Act of 1974 provides for the comprehensive regulation of campaign financing and related matters, including the reporting of gifts, as defined. The act prohibits specified officers from receiving gifts in excess of $440 in value from a single source in a calendar year. The act exempts gift payments for the actual costs of specified types of travel that are reasonably related to a legislative or governmental purpose, or to an issue of state, national, or international public policy, from the annual limit on the value of gifts from a single source.
This bill would require a nonprofit organization that regularly organizes and hosts travel for elected officials, as specified, and that pays for these types of travel for an elected state officer or local elected officeholder to disclose the names of donors who, in the preceding year, both donated to the nonprofit organization and accompanied an elected officer or officeholder for any portion of the travel, as specified. The bill would require a person who receives a gift of a travel payment from any source to report the travel destination on his or her statement of economic interests.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 87207 of the Government Code proposed by both this bill and AB 10, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.
A violation of the act’s provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Government Code, with respect to the income tax reporting requirements of State and local governments, to require a tax statement to include: the name and address of each source of income aggregating five hundred dollars ($500) or more in value, or fifty dollars ($50) or more in value if the income was a gift; a statement whether the aggregate value of income from each source, or in the case of a loan, the highest amount owed to each source, was at least five hundred dollars ($1,000) but did not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) whether it was greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) but not greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), or whether it was greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000); a description of the consideration for which the income was received; in the case of a gift, the amount and the date on which the gift was received and the travel destination for purposes of a gift that is a travel payment, advance, or reimbursement; and the annual interest rate, the security, if any, given for the loan and the term of the loan.

"The Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Act creates a state medical contract program to increase the number of students and residents receiving quality education and training in specified primary care specialties or in nursing, and to maximize the delivery of primary care and family physician services to specific areas of California where there is a recognized unmet priority need for those services. The act requires the Director of Statewide Health Planning and Development to, among other things, contract with accredited medical schools, teaching health centers, training programs, hospitals, and other health care delivery systems for those purposes, based on recommendations of the California Healthcare Workforce Policy Commission and in conformity with the contract criteria and program standards established by the commission.
This bill would appropriate $300,000,000 from the General Fund to the director for the purpose of funding new and existing graduate medical education physician residency positions, and supporting training faculty, pursuant to the act, for expenditure as specified. The bill would also make related findings and declarations.
Existing law, the Song-Brown Health Care Workforce Training Act, declares the intent of the Legislature to increase the number of students and residents receiving quality education and training in the specialty of family practice and as primary care physician’s assistants and primary care nurse practitioners. Existing law establishes, for this purpose, a state medical contract program with accredited medical schools, programs that train primary care physician’s assistants, programs that train primary care nurse practitioners, registered nurses, hospitals, and other health care delivery systems.
Existing law requires the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development to establish the Health Professions Education Foundation to solicit and receive funds for the purpose of providing financial assistance in the form of scholarships or loans to medical students from underrepresented groups. Under existing law, the foundation also administers other programs for the advancement of health professions, including the Registered Nurse Education Program.
This bill would establish the Medical Residency Training Advisory Panel, consisting of a total of 13 members to be appointed as specified, within the Health Professions Education Foundation.
The bill would create the Medical Residency Training Fund in the State Treasury, a continuously appropriated fund, and would require the panel to solicit and accept funds from business, industry, foundations, and other private or public sources for the purpose of establishing and funding new graduate medical residency training programs in specified areas of the state, including medically underserved areas. By creating a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation. The bill would require the foundation to provide technical support and financial management for the panel and to approve and send panel recommendations for new residency programs to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development for implementation if specified requirements are met, including sufficient funding. The bill would require the office to enter into contracts with public and private sector institutions and other health agencies and organizations in order to fund and establish recommended residency positions. The bill would authorize the Governor to include in the annual budget proposal an amount, as he or she deems reasonable, to be appropriated for this purpose. The bill, if the Legislature appropriates money for this purpose, would require the office to hold the funds and distribute them into the fund, upon request of the panel, in an amount matching the amount deposited into the fund, as specified. The bill would require money that was appropriated, but that has not been distributed to the fund at the end of each fiscal year, to be returned to the General Fund.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","This bill makes continuous appropriations from the General Fund to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development for the purpose of funding new and existing graduate medical education physician residency positions, and supporting training faculty, pursuant to the Medical Training Fund Act. The bill establishes the Medical Residency Training Advisory Panel to advise the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development on the establishment and operation of medical residency training programs in California."
"Existing law requires each county to provide cash assistance and other social services to needy families through the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program using federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant program, state, and county funds. Under existing law, for purposes of determining a family’s maximum aid payment under the CalWORKs program, the number of needy persons in the same family is not increased for any child born into a family that has received aid under the CalWORKs program continuously for the 10 months prior to the birth of the child, with specified exceptions.
This bill would repeal that exclusion for purposes of determining the family’s maximum aid payment and would expressly prohibit the denial of aid, or the denial of an increase in the maximum aid payment, if a child, on whose behalf aid or an increase in aid is being requested, was born into an applicant’s or recipient’s family while the applicant’s or recipient’s family was receiving aid under the CalWORKs program. The bill would specify that an applicant or recipient is not entitled to an increased benefit payment for any month prior to January 1, 2016, as a result of the repeal of that exclusion or the enactment of that express prohibition. The bill would also prohibit the department from conditioning an applicant’s or recipient’s eligibility for aid on the applicant’s or recipient’s disclosure of information regarding rape, incest, or contraception, as specified, or the applicant’s or recipient’s use of contraception.
Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county aid grant costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would declare that no appropriation would be made for purposes of the bill.
To the extent that this bill affects eligibility under the CalWORKs program, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code, with respect to the maximum family grant program, to prohibit an applicant for, or recipient of, aid under such program from being required, as a result of rape or incest, to: (1) share confidential medical records with any member of the assistance unit living in rape or incest; or (2) choose a particular method of contraception or sterilization of any member of the assistance unit living in rape or incest. An applicant for, or recipient of, aid under such program shall not be denied aid, or denied an increase in the maximum aid payment, for a child born into the applicant or recipient family unit not receiving aid under such program during a period in which the applicant or recipient family was not receiving aid under such program for 24 consecutive months. The number of needy persons in the same family shall not be increased for any child born into a family that has received aid under such program continuously for the 10 months before, or within three months after, the birth of the child, or if paternity has been established if the family does not receive aid during two consecutive months. This bill shall not apply to any child conceived as a result of contraceptive failure if the parent was using an intrauterine contraception device,"
"The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA) requires a public retirement system, as defined, to modify its plan or plans to comply with the act and, among other provisions, establishes new retirement formulas that may not be exceeded by a public employer offering a defined benefit pension plan for employees first hired on or after January 1, 2013. Existing law, the Joint Exercise of Powers Act, generally authorizes 2 or more public agencies, by agreement, to jointly exercise any common power, which may include hiring employees and establishing retirement systems. PEPRA authorizes a joint powers authority formed by the Cities of Brea and Fullerton on or after January 1, 2013, to provide its employees the defined benefit plan or formula that those employees received from their respective employers prior to the exercise of a common power, to which the employee is associated, by the joint powers authority to any employee of specified cities who is not a new member and subsequently is employed by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the city providing for the exercise of a common power, to which the employee was associated, by the joint powers authority.
This bill would authorize a joint powers authority formed by the Belmont Fire Protection District, the Estero Municipal Improvement District, and the City of San Mateo on or after January 1, 2013, to provide employees who are not new members under PEPRA with the defined benefit plan or formula that was received by those employees from their respective employers on December 31, 2012, if they are employed by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the agency providing for the exercise of a common power, to which the employee was associated, by the joint powers authority. The bill would prohibit the formation of a joint powers authority on or after January 1, 2013, in a manner that would exempt a new employee or a new member from the requirements of PEPRA.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Belmont Fire Protection District, the Estero Municipal Improvement District, and the City of San Mateo.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2012.

"(1) Existing law regulates the distribution and use of livestock drugs, as defined, by the Secretary of Food and Agriculture. Existing law also requires a person to obtain a license from the secretary to manufacture, sell, distribute, or store commercial feed, including commercial feed containing drugs.
This bill would, beginning January 1, 2018, prohibit the administration of medically important antimicrobial drugs, as defined, to livestock unless ordered by a licensed veterinarian through a prescription or veterinary feed directive pursuant to a veterinarian-client-patient relationship, as specified, and would prohibit the administration of a medically important antimicrobial drug to livestock solely for purposes of promoting weight gain or improving feed efficiency. The bill would require the Department of Food and Agriculture, in consultation with the Veterinary Medical Board, the State Department of Public Health, universities, and cooperative extensions, to develop antimicrobial stewardship guidelines and best management practices on the proper use of medically important antimicrobial drugs and would require the department to gather information on medically important antimicrobial drug sales and usage, antimicrobial resistant bacteria, and livestock management practice data. The bill would require information provided pursuant to those provisions to be held confidential, as specified. The bill would authorize the department to request and receive copies of veterinary feed directives from certain persons to implement the bill’s provisions. The bill would make a first violation of the bill’s provisions subject to a civil penalty of up to $250 for each day a violation occurs, and would make second and subsequent violations subject to an administrative fine of $500 for each day a violation occurs, except as specified.
(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","This bill amends the Food and Agricultural Code to prohibit the administration of medically important antimicrobial drugs to livestock unless ordered by a licensed veterinarian through a prescription or veterinary feed directive. A &ldquo;medically important antimicrobial drug&rdquo; is an antimicrobial drug listed in Appendix A of the Food and Drug Administration's Guidance for Industry #152 that is: critically important, highly important, and important in the professional judgment of a licensed veterinarian; necessary to treat a disease or infection; necessary to control the spread of a disease or infection; or necessary in relation to surgery or a medical procedure. A medically important antimicrobial drug may also be used when, in the professional judgment of a licensed veterinarian, it is needed for prophylaxis to address an elevated risk of contraction of a particular disease or infection. A person shall not administer a medically important antimicrobial drug to livestock solely for purposes of promoting weight gain or improving feed efficiency unless the administration is consistent with this bill. Medically important antimicrobial drugs may be sold by retailers licensed under the Business and Professions Code."
"Existing law requires specified categories of law enforcement officers to meet training standards pursuant to courses of training certified by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST). Existing law requires POST to include in its basic training course adequate instruction in the handling of persons with developmental disabilities or mental illness, or both. Existing law also requires POST to establish and keep updated a continuing education classroom training course relating to law enforcement interaction with developmentally disabled and mentally ill persons.
This bill would require POST to require field training officers who are instructors for the field training program to have at least 8 hours of crisis intervention behavioral health training, as specified. The bill would also require POST to require as part of its existing field training officer course, at least 4 hours of training relating to competencies of the field training program and police training program that addresses how to interact with persons with mental illness or intellectual disability, to be completed as specified.
By requiring local law enforcement field training officers to have at least 8 additional hours of training and imposing additional training costs on local law enforcement agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 14, 2016.

"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services and under which qualified low-income persons receive health care benefits. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid provisions.
Existing federal law requires the state to seek adjustment or recovery from an individual’s estate for specified medical assistance, including nursing facility services, home and community-based services, and related hospital and prescription drug services, if the individual was 55 years of age or older when he or she received the medical assistance. Existing federal law allows the state, at its own option, to seek recovery for any items or services covered under the state’s Medicaid plan.
Existing state law, with certain exceptions, requires the department to claim against the estate of a decedent, or against any recipient of the property of that decedent by distribution or survival, an amount equal to the payments for Medi-Cal services received or the value of the property received by any recipient from the decedent by distribution or survival, whichever is less. Existing law provides for certain exemptions that restrict the department from filing a claim against a decedent’s property, including when there is a surviving spouse during his or her lifetime. Existing law requires the department, however, to make a claim upon the death of the surviving spouse, as prescribed. Existing law requires the department to waive its claim, in whole or in part, if it determines that enforcement of the claim would result in a substantial hardship, as specified. Existing law, which has been held invalid by existing case law, provides that the exemptions shall only apply to the proportionate share of the decedent’s estate or property that passes to those recipients, by survival or distribution, who qualify for the exemptions.
This bill would instead require the department to make these claims only in specified circumstances for those health care services that the state is required to recover under federal law, and would define health care services for these purposes. The bill would limit any claims against the estate of a decedent to only the real and personal property or other assets the state is required to seek recovery from under federal law. The bill would delete the proportionate share provision and would delete the requirement that the department make a claim upon the death of the surviving spouse. The bill would require the department to waive its claim when the estate subject to recovery is a homestead of modest value, as defined. The bill would limit the amount of interest that is entitled to accrue on a voluntary postdeath lien, as specified. The bill would also require the department to provide a current or former beneficiary, or his or her authorized representative, upon request, with the total amount of Medi-Cal expenses that have been paid on his or her behalf that would be recoverable under these provisions, as specified. The bill would apply the changes made by these provisions only to individuals who die on or after January 1, 2016.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)

Directs the department, in determining such a claim, to: (1) waive the claim against the surviving spouse, if the surviving spouse is under 21 years of age; and (2) ensure that a surviving child who is blind or permanently and totally disabled can easily and timely receive information about how much Medi-estate recovery can be spent on behalf of the individual."

Existing law specifies that the financial components of the California Solar Initiative include the New Solar Homes Partnership Program, which is administered by the Energy Commission. Existing law requires the program to be funded by charges in the amount of $400,000,000 collected from customers of the state’s 3 largest electrical corporations. If moneys from the Renewable Resource Trust Fund for the program are exhausted, existing law authorizes the PUC, upon notification by the Energy Commission, to require those electrical corporations to continue the administration of the program pursuant to the guidelines established by the Energy Commission for the program until the $400,000,000 monetary limit is reached. Existing law authorizes the PUC to determine if a 3rd party, including the Energy Commission, should administer the electrical corporations’ continuation of the program. Existing law makes the New Solar Homes Partnership Program inoperative on June 1, 2018, and requires any funding made available be encumbered no later than June 1, 2018, and disbursed no later than December 31, 2021.
If the PUC determines that the Energy Commission should be the 3rd-party administrator for the New Solar Homes Partnership Program, this bill would require that any additional moneys made available to fund the New Solar Homes Partnership Program be deposited into the Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the Renewable Resource Trust Fund and used for this purpose.
Existing law authorizes the Department of Finance to furnish services, or provide work for, any other state agency as requested by the Legislature and authorizes the department to charge an amount sufficient to recover the cost of furnishing services or the work performed.

"(1) Existing law permits minors who are detained in juvenile hall for habitual disobedience, truancy, or curfew violation to be held in the same facility as minors who are detained for violating any law or ordinance defining a crime, if they do not come or remain in contact with each other. Existing law also permits the detention of minors in jails and other secure facilities for the confinement of adults if the minors do not come or remain in contact with confined adults and other specified conditions are met.
Existing law, the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, authorizes the involuntary detention for a period of 72 hours for the evaluation of a person, including a minor who is dangerous to himself or herself or others, or gravely disabled, as defined.
This bill would prohibit a person confined in a juvenile facility who is an imminent danger to himself, herself, or others as a result of a mental disorder, or who is gravely disabled, from being subject to solitary confinement. The bill would also prohibit a person, other than a person described above, who is detained in any secure state or local juvenile facility from being subject to solitary confinement unless certain conditions are satisfied, including that the person poses an immediate and substantial risk of harm to the security of the facility, to himself or herself, or to others that is not the result of a mental disorder. The bill would permit, if those conditions are satisfied, the person to be held in solitary confinement only in accordance with specified guidelines, including that the person be held in solitary confinement only for the minimum time required to address the risk, and that does not compromise the mental and physical health of the person, but no longer than 4 hours. The bill would require each local and state juvenile facility to document the usage of solitary confinement, as prescribed. The bill would authorize a person confined in a juvenile facility to request a voluntary time out, as defined, for no longer than 2 hours
in a 24
-hour period
and would require voluntary time outs to be documented. By increasing the duties of local juvenile facilities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law establishes a juvenile justice commission in each county, but authorizes the boards of supervisors of 2 or more adjacent counties to agree to establish a regional juvenile justice commission in lieu of a county juvenile justice commission. Existing law specifies the membership of these commissions, including that 2 or more members shall be persons who are 14 to 21 years of age, inclusive, and that a regional juvenile justice commission shall consist of not less than 8 citizens.
This bill would increase the membership of a regional juvenile justice commission to no less than 10 members. The bill would also require that 2 or more members of a juvenile justice commission or a regional juvenile justice commission be parents or guardians of previously incarcerated youth, and one member be a licensed psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker with expertise in adolescent development.
Existing law requires a juvenile justice commission to annually inspect any jail or lockup that, in the preceding calendar year, was used for confinement for more than 24 hours of any minor, and to report the results of the inspection, together with its recommendations based thereon, in writing, to the juvenile court and the Board of State and Community Corrections.
This bill would instead require a juvenile justice commission to inspect any jail, lockup, or facility that, in the preceding calendar year, was used for confinement for more than 24 hours of any minor and would require, as a part of that inspection, a review of the records of the jail, lockup, or facility relating to the use of solitary confinement. The bill would require the commission to report the results of the inspection, together with its recommendations based thereon, in writing, to the juvenile court, the Board of State and Community Corrections, and the county board of supervisors. The bill would require the commission to annually present its report at a regularly scheduled public meeting of the county board of supervisors, and to publish the report on the county government’s Internet Web site. The bill also would authorize a commission to publicize its recommendations made to any person charged with administration of the Juvenile Court Law on the county government’s Internet Web site or other publicly accessible medium.
By increasing the duties of local commissions and county boards of supervisors, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to allow solitary confinement in juvenile facilities only if: (1) the person poses an immediate and substantial risk of harm to the security of the facility, to himself or herself, or to others that is not the result of a mental disorder; (2) all other less-restrictive programming has been attempted and exhausted; and (3) the performance of solitary confinement is done in accordance with specified guidelines, including that the person may be held in solitary confinement only for the minimum time required to address the risk and for a period of time that does not compromise the mental and physical health of the minor or ward, but not to exceed four hours. Prohibits the use of consecutive periods of solitary confinement.Requires each local and state juvenile facility to document the use of solitary confinement, including: (1) the name, age, gender, and race of the person subject to solitary confinement; (2) the date and time the person was placed in solitary confinement; (3) the names of staff involved in the placement of the person in solitary confinement; (4) a description of circumstances leading to the use of solitary confinement; (5) the person's behavior during the periods of solitary confinement; and (6) the dates and times when staff checked in on the person when he or she was in solitary confinement"
"Existing law, the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Law of 1997, establishes the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund to provide grants or revolving fund loans for the design and construction of projects for public water systems that will enable those systems to meet safe drinking water standards.
This bill would require the State Water Resources Control Board to establish a program to provide low-interest loans and grants to local agencies for low-interest loans and grants to eligible applicants for specified purposes relating to drinking water and wastewater treatment. This bill would create the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund and provide that the moneys in this fund are available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the board for expenditure for the program. This bill would transfer to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund $10,000,000 from the General Fund.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.
(1)The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment. CEQA establishes a procedure by which a person may seek judicial review of the decision of the lead agency made pursuant to CEQA and a procedure for the preparation and certification of the record of proceedings upon the filing of an action or proceeding challenging a lead agency’s action on the grounds of noncompliance with CEQA.
The Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, (Proposition 1), approved by the voters on the November 2, 2014 statewide general election, authorizes the issuance of bonds in the amount of $7,120,000,000 pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law to finance a water quality, supply, and infrastructure improvement program.

Because a public agency would be required to comply with those new procedures, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the Judicial Council, on or before July 1, 2016, to adopt a rule of court to establish procedures applicable to actions or proceedings seeking judicial review of a public agency’s action in certifying the environmental impact report and in granting project approval for those projects that require the actions or proceedings, including any appeals therefrom, be resolved, to the extent feasible, within 270 days of the certification of the record of proceedings. The bill would prohibit a court from staying or enjoining those projects unless it makes specified findings.
(2)The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires the State of California to establish a program to provide low-interest loans and grants to local agencies for: (1) extending or connecting service lines from a water or wastewater system to an applicant's residence or plumbing; (2) paying reasonable charges or fees for connecting to such system; (3) paying costs to close abandoned septic tanks and water wells; (4) improving an existing groundwater well; and (5) installing a water treatment system if the groundwater exceeds a primary or secondary drinking standard. The bill creates a Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund for the loans and grants. Funds are available from the Fund pursuant to appropriations by the Legislature. The bill sets forth eligibility criteria for loan and grant applicants, including: (1) household income of 60 percent or less of the statewide median household income; and (2) an ownership interest in the residence of at least five years."

For cities, counties, and cities and counties that notify the Controller of their election by April 30, 2017, and for platforms that notify the Controller of their election by March 1, 2017, this collection and remittance would begin on July 1, 2017. For platforms and cities, counties, or cities and counties that provide notifications to the Controller after those dates, the collection and remittance would begin at least 6 months after notification, as specified. The bill would authorize a city, county, or city and county to discontinue an election and would make this discontinuance effective at least 6 months after notification to the Controller. The bill would also authorize a platform to discontinue its election, entirely or in part, effective as specified.
This bill, by December 31, 2018, and by December 31 of each year thereafter, would require the Controller to review or audit a platform’s collection and remittance of tax revenue pursuant to the above-described provisions, would further require the Controller to submit a final report containing specific information to each city, county, or city and county in which the platform collected and remitted taxes, and would authorize the platform or the city, county, or city and county to appeal findings identified in the report, as provided.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","This bill allows a city, county, or city and county to elect to become a participating platform and collect and remit transient occupancy tax on rental transactions facilitated by the platform for any unit offered for occupancy for tourist or transient use for compensation to an operator within its jurisdiction.

Existing law requires the Independent System Operator to ensure efficient use and reliable operation of the electrical transmission grid consistent with achieving planning and operating reserve criteria no less stringent than those established by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and the North American Electric Reliability Council. An Electricity Oversight Board is also established to oversee the Independent System Operator and the Power Exchange in order to ensure the success of electrical restructuring and to ensure a reliable supply of electricity in the transition to a new market structure. Existing law prohibits the Independent System Operator from entering into a multistate entity or regional organization unless the Independent System Operator receives approval from the Electricity Oversight Board.
This bill would authorize the Independent System Operator to enter into a multistate entity or regional organization if that entry is approved by its governing board at a duly noticed public meeting.
Existing law, relative to restructuring of the electrical industry, states the intent of the Legislature with respect to the evolution of the roles of the Independent System Operator and Power Exchange, including to evolve into regional organizations to promote the development of regional electricity transmission markets in the western states and to improve the access of consumers serviced by the Independent System Operator and the Power Exchange to those markets.

The bill would require the court or magistrate to order the detention of the person for a period of not more than 10 days, and direct the district attorney to notify the appropriate court, probation or parole officer, or federal, state or local law enforcement official, if the court or magistrate determines the person may flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community and the person is, and was at the time the offense was committed, released pending trial, released pending imposition or execution of sentence, appeal of sentence or conviction, or completion of sentence, or on conditional release, probation, postrelease community supervision, or parole.
The California Constitution requires that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable and that the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented. Existing law declares that the use of potable domestic water for certain nonpotable uses is a waste or an unreasonable use of water if recycled water is available, as determined by the State Water Resources Control Board, and other requirements are met.
Under existing law, the state board and the 9 California regional water quality control boards prescribe waste discharge requirements in accordance with the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit program established by the federal Clean Water Act and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.
This bill would declare that, except in compliance with the bill’s provisions, it is a waste and unreasonable use of water to discharge treated wastewater from an ocean or bay outfall, or for a water supplier or water replenishment district to not take treated wastewater made available for certain purposes. The bill would require the state board to promulgate regulations, on or before January 1, 2020, that would require each NPDES permitholder, on or before January 1, 2023, to submit to the state board the permitholder’s plans to achieve beneficial reuse, to the maximum extent possible, of treated wastewater that would otherwise be discharged through ocean or bay outfalls. The bill would require these regulations to require, on or before January 1, 2033, the beneficial reuse of at least 50% of treated wastewater that the NPDES permitholder would otherwise discharge though ocean or bay outfalls relative to the inflow to the treatment plant. The bill would require the regulations to provide operational and compliance flexibility, as specified. The bill would authorize the state board to convene an advisory group and to consider any other recommendations or testimony provided during the regulation adoption process. The bill would authorize the state board to adopt reasonable fees payable by a holder of an NPDES permit to recover costs incurred in administering these provisions.","Amends the State of California criminal code to require the court or magistrate of a person charged with a criminal offense, upon the appearance before such court or magistrate, to hold a hearing and order that, pending trial, such person be one of the following: released on his or her own recognizance or upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond; released on a condition or combination of conditions; detained to permit revocation of conditional release, probation, parole, or post-release community supervision; and detained pursuant to this Act. Directs the court or magistrate to order the pretrial release of such person, or upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond, in an amount specified by the court, subject to the condition that the person not commit a Federal, State, or local crime during the period of release unless, after a hearing held pursuant to this Act, the court or magistrate determines that release will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of any other person or the community.

"Existing law, as amended by Proposition 83, the Sexual Predator Punishment and Control Act (Jessica’s Law), approved by the voters at the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, provides that a defendant shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years to life if convicted of certain crimes, including rape, sexual penetration, sodomy, oral copulation, continuous sexual abuse of a child, or rape, spousal rape, or sexual penetration in concert, if certain circumstances were present, including, among other things, if the defendant has been previously convicted of a specified offense. Proposition 83 provides that the Legislature may amend the provisions of the act to expand the scope of their application or increase the punishment or penalties by a statute passed by a majority vote of each house.
This bill would specify that the
25-year to life
prison term
of 25 years to life

a separate violation of a
more than one
specified offense
on charges brought and tried separately,
irrespective of the order in which the offenses were committed or the convictions obtained.","Amends the Federal criminal code to revise penalties for aggravated sexual abuse of a child to provide that a person convicted of such an offense shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years to life, except as provided in specified circumstances.

"Existing law imposes various civil penalties for violations of specified provisions of the Fish and Game Code in connection with the production or cultivation of a controlled substance. Existing law requires all civil penalties collected to be apportioned as provided, including 30% of the funds to be distributed to the investigating agency to be used to reimburse the cost of any investigation directly related to the violations described in these provisions.
Existing law authorizes the Department of Fish and Wildlife to impose those civil penalties administratively, subject to specified requirements relating to complaint and hearing procedures, among other things. Existing law authorizes the department to adopt regulations to implement these provisions and requires the administrative penalties collected to be apportioned in a specified manner.
This bill would impose various additional civil penalties, subject to these provisions, for violations of specified provisions of the Penal Code and the Public Resources Code, in connection with the production or cultivation of a controlled substance.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Fish and Game Code and specified other Federal law to increase civil penalties for persons found to have violated prohibitions against the production or cultivation of controlled substances on public land managed by the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the State Lands Commission, a regional park district, the United States Forest Service, or the United States Bureau of Land Management, or within the respective ownership of a timberland production zone, where the controlled substance is grown or cultivated."
"(1) Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to engage in disorderly conduct that delays or prevents a fire from being timely extinguished or to resist or interfere with the lawful efforts of a firefighter in the discharge of an official duty. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to impede police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel, or military personnel in the performance of their duties in coping with an emergency.
This bill would make it unlawful to knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly operate an unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system, as defined, in a manner that prevents or delays the extinguishment of a fire, or in any way interferes with the efforts of firefighters to control, contain, or extinguish a fire. The bill would make a violation of this prohibition punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed 6 months, by a fine not to exceed $5,000, or by both that fine and imprisonment. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law provides certain individuals with immunity from civil liability under specific circumstances, including, among others, limiting the civil liability of a person who in good faith, and not for compensation, renders emergency medical or nonmedical care at the scene of an emergency, as specified.
This bill would further limit the exposure to civil liability of an emergency responder, defined as an unpaid volunteer or private entity acting within the scope of authority implicitly or expressly provided by a public entity or a public employee to provide emergency services, for damages to an unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system, if the damage was caused while the emergency responder was performing specific emergency services and the unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system was interfering with the provision of those emergency services.
(3) The Government Claims Act sets forth the general procedure for the presentation of a claim as a prerequisite to the commencement of an action for money or damages against a “public entity” or a “public employee,” and defines those terms for its purposes. The act prohibits liability against a public entity or public employee for, among other things, certain acts relating to the provision of fire protection and police and correctional activities, as specified.
This bill would further limit the exposure to civil liability of a public entity or public employee for damage to an unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system, if the damage was caused while the public entity or public employee was performing specific emergency services and the unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system was interfering with the provision of those emergency services.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(5) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","Amends the Civil Code to provide that an emergency responder shall not be liable for any damage to an unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system, if the damage was caused while the responder was providing, and the unmanned aircraft or unmanned aircraft system was interfering with the operation, support, or enabling of the emergency services listed in specified provisions of the Government Code, if acting within the scope of authority or expressly provided by a public entity or a public employee to provide emergency services: (1) emergency medical services or ambulance transport services; (2) firefighting or firefighting-related services; or (3) search and rescue services.

"Existing law, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, requires all groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins by the Department of Water Resources that are designated as basins subject to critical conditions of overdraft to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2020, and requires all other groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2022, except as specified. Existing law authorizes a groundwater sustainability agency to require through its groundwater sustainability plan that the use of every groundwater extraction facility within the management area of the groundwater sustainablity agency be measured by a water-measuring device, but provides that these provisions do not apply to de minimis extractors. Existing law authorizes a groundwater sustainability agency to impose fees but prohibits a groundwater sustainability agency from imposing a fee to fund the costs of a groundwater sustainability program on a de minimis extractor unless the agency has regulated the users pursuant to the act. Existing law generally excepts a de minimis extractor from the requirement that a person who extracts groundwater from a probationary basin, as prescribed, or extracts groundwater on or after July 1, 2017, in an area within a basin that is not within the management area of a groundwater sustainability agency and where the county does not assume responsibility to be the groundwater sustainability agency has to file a report of groundwater extraction by December 15 of each year for extractions made in the preceding water year with the State Water Resources Control Board. Existing law defines a de minimis extractor for these purposes as a person who extracts, for domestic purposes, 2 acre-feet or less per year.
This bill would define a de minimis extractor for the purposes of these provisions as a person who extracts, for domestic purposes, 10 acre-feet or less per year.","Amends the Water Code to require the governing body of a groundwater sustainability agency, unless a satisfactory showing is made to the governing body that the groundwater extraction facility actually is operated by some other person, to presume that the owner of a groundwater extraction facility is the operator unless a satisfactory showing is made to the governing body that the groundwater extraction facility actually is operated by some other person. Defines &quot;owner&quot; as a person owning a groundwater extraction facility or an interest in a groundwater extraction facility other than a lien to secure payment of a debt or other obligation."
"Existing law authorizes a court in a criminal proceeding, upon written notice by the prosecutor made at least 3 days prior to the date of the preliminary hearing or trial date on which the testimony of the minor is scheduled or during the course of the proceeding on the court’s own motion, to order that the testimony of a minor 13 years of age or younger at the time of the motion be taken by contemporaneous examination and cross-examination in another place and out of the presence of the judge, jury, defendant or defendants, and attorneys, and communicated to the courtroom by means of closed-circuit television, if the court makes specified findings. One of the findings existing law requires is that the minor’s testimony will involve a recitation of the facts of specified crimes, including an alleged violent felony of which the minor is a victim.
This bill would authorize a minor 13 years of age or younger to testify by contemporaneous examination and cross-examination if the testimony will involve the recitation of the facts of an alleged violent felony, whether or not the minor is a victim.","Amends the California criminal code to authorize the court in a criminal proceeding to order a minor 13 or younger to make testimony even if two-way closed-circuit television is used to take contemporaneous examination and cross-examination in another place and out of the charged presence of the judge, jury, defendant or defendants, and communicated to the minor by means of closed-circuit television if the court makes specified findings: (1) the minor's testimony will involve recitation of the facts of an alleged sexual offense or violent felony with respect to which the minor is a victim and the impact on the minor of one or more specified factors; (2) the impact on the minor of one or more of specified factors is shown by clear and convincing evidence to be substantial as to make the minor unavailable as a witness unless closed-circuit testimony is used; (3) the defendant or his or her counsel during the hearing or trial in a way that caused the minor to be unable to continue his or her testimony unless two-way or one-way closed-circuit television is used; and (4) the minor's relationship with the defendant or defendants, the nature of the acts charged, and the good cause of the refusal to testify shall not alone constitute sufficient evidence to obtain the minor's testimony.

"(1) Existing law provides that a search warrant may only be issued upon probable cause, supported by affidavit, naming or describing the person to be searched or searched for, and particularly describing the property, thing, or things and the place to be searched. Existing law also states the grounds upon which a search warrant may be issued, including, among other grounds, when the property or things to be seized consist of any item or constitute any evidence that tends to show a felony has been committed, or tends to show that a particular person has committed a felony, or when there is a warrant to arrest a person.
This bill would prohibit a government entity from compelling the production of or access to electronic communication information or electronic device information, as defined, without a search warrant, wiretap order, order for electronic reader records, or subpoena issued pursuant under specified conditions, except for emergency situations, as defined. The bill would also specify the conditions under which a government entity may access electronic device information by means of physical interaction or electronic communication with the device, such as pursuant to a search warrant, wiretap order, or consent of the owner of the device. The bill would define a number of terms for those purposes, including, among others, “electronic communication information” and “electronic device information,” which the bill defines collectively as “electronic information.” The bill would require a search warrant for electronic information to describe with particularity the information to be seized and would impose other conditions on the use of the search warrant or wiretap order and the information obtained, including retention, sealing, and disclosure. The bill would require a warrant directed to a service provider to be accompanied by an order requiring the service provider to verify by affidavit the authenticity of electronic information that it produces, as specified. The bill would authorize a service provider to voluntarily disclose, when not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, electronic communication information or subscriber information, and would require a government entity to destroy information so provided within 90 days, subject to specified exceptions. The bill would, subject to exceptions, require a government entity that executes a search warrant pursuant to these provisions to contemporaneously provide notice, as specified, to the identified target, that informs the recipient that information about the recipient has been compelled or requested, and that states the nature of the government investigation under which the information is sought. The bill would authorize a delay of 90 days, subject to renewal, for providing the notice under specified conditions that constitute an emergency. The bill would require the notice to include a copy of the warrant or statement describing the emergency under which the notice was delayed. The bill would provide that any person in a trial, hearing, or proceeding may move to suppress any electronic information obtained or retained in violation of its provisions, according to specified procedures. The bill would provide that a California or foreign corporation, and its officers, employees, and agents, are not subject to any cause of action for providing records, information, facilities, or assistance in accordance with the terms of a warrant, wiretap order, or other order issued pursuant to these provisions.
(2) The California Constitution provides for the Right to Truth in Evidence, which requires a
2/3
vote of the Legislature to exclude any relevant evidence from any criminal proceeding, as specified.
Because this bill would exclude evidence obtained or retained in violation of its provisions in a criminal proceeding, it requires a
2/3
vote of the Legislature.","Amends the Penal Code to prohibit a state, local, or tribal government entity from: (1) compelling the production of or access to electronic communication information from an electronic communication service provider; (2) compelling the production of or access to electronic communication information from any person or entity other than the authorized possessor of the device; or (3) accessing electronic device information by means of physical interaction or electronic communication with the device only under specified circumstances. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit the intended recipient of an electronic communication from voluntarily disclosing such information to a government entity."
"This bill would enact the First Validating Act of 2015, which would validate the organization, boundaries, acts, proceedings, and bonds of the state and counties, cities, and specified districts, agencies, and entities.

"(1) The existing Municipal Utility District Act authorizes the formation of a municipal utility district. The act authorizes a district to acquire, construct, own, operate, control, or use works for supplying the inhabitants of the district and public agencies with light, water, power, heat, transportation, telephone service, or other means of communication, or means for the collection, treatment, or disposition of garbage, sewage, or refuse matter. The act authorizes a municipal utility district, by resolution or ordinance, to require the owner of record of privately owned real property within the district to pay the fees, tolls, rates, rentals, or other charges for certain utility services rendered to a lessee, tenant, or subtenant, and provides that those charges that have become delinquent, together with interest and penalties, are a lien on the property when a certificate is filed by the district in the office of the county recorder and that the lien has the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien.
The act, in addition to the above-described methods, establishes procedures, until January 1, 2016, for a municipal utility district to collect delinquent fees, tolls, rates, rentals, or other charges, together with interest and penalties thereon, for services rendered to a lessee, tenant, or subtenant, through the tax roll, in the same manner as property taxes. The act, until January 1, 2016, authorizes a municipal utility district to collect delinquent fees, tolls, rates, rentals, or other charges, together with interest and penalties thereon, for services rendered to a lessee, tenant, or subtenant, by recording in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the affected parcel is located, a certificate declaring the amount of the delinquent charges, together with interest and penalties thereon, which would then constitute a lien against the affected real property of the delinquent property owner in that county and have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien. The act, until January 1, 2016, requires a municipal utility district that exercises these collection measures to reimburse the county for the reasonable expenses incurred by the county.
This bill would extend the operation of these provisions indefinitely. By requiring county auditors and recorders to undertake certain actions in response to the exercise of collection measures by a municipal utility district, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) The act prohibits a municipal utility district from collecting delinquent fees or charges using the above-described collection measures for the furnishing of electrical services and, beginning January 1, 2016, for the furnishing of water or sewer service to residential property.
This bill would permanently authorize a municipal utility district to collect delinquent fees or charges using the above-described collection measures for the furnishing of water or sewer service to residential property.
(3) The act requires any district that places a lien on a property for water or sewer service on or before December 31, 2014, pursuant to the above-described collection measures, to submit a report containing certain information to the Assembly and Senate Committees on Judiciary and to the Assembly and Senate Committees on Local Government on or before January 1, 2015.
This bill would delete this provision.

No lien may be created under this section on any publicly owned property. A lien attaches when a district files for recordation in the office of the county recorder a certificate specifying the amount of the delinquent fees, tolls, rates, rentals, or other charges together with interest and penalties and the name of the owner of record of the property to which services were rendered by the district and the legal description of the property.

"Existing law, the California Finance Lenders Law, provides for the licensure and regulation of finance lenders by the Commissioner of Business Oversight. Existing law makes a willful violation of the law by any person a crime. Existing law defines a finance lender as any person who is engaged in the business of making consumer loans or commercial loans. Existing law defines a commercial loan as a loan of a principal amount of $5,000 or more, or any loan under an open-end credit program, whether secured by either real or personal property, or both, or unsecured, the proceeds of which are intended by the borrower for use primarily for purposes other than personal, family, or household.
This bill would authorize a licensed finance lender to compensate an unlicensed person in connection with the referral, as defined, of one or more prospective borrowers to the licensee for a commercial loan if certain requirements are met. These requirements would include, among other things, that the referral leads to the consummation of a commercial loan, the loan contract provides for an annual percentage rate that does not exceed a certain percentage, the licensed finance lender obtains documentation from the prospective borrower documenting the borrower’s commercial status, and that the licensee maintains records of compensation paid to an unlicensed person, as specified. The bill would make a licensee paying compensation to an unlicensed person in connection with a referral liable for any misrepresentation made to a borrower in connection with that loan made to that borrower by that licensee. The bill would authorize the commissioner to adopt regulations imposing conditions on this referral activity, as specified. The bill would also require a licensed finance lender who receives an application for a commercial loan from a prospective borrower who has been referred by an unlicensed person to provide a specified statement to the borrower regarding the referral arrangement. The bill would prohibit any person receiving compensation in connection with a referral that leads to the consummation of a commercial loan from engaging in specified acts and would authorize the commissioner to order this person to desist and refrain from engaging in the business or further violating those provisions governing such referral.
By creating new requirements, the willful violation of which would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Financial Code to authorize a licensee of a finance lender to pay compensation to an unlicensed person in connection with the referral of one or more prospective borrowers, provided that: (1) the referral leads to the consummation of a commercial loan between the licensee and the prospective borrower referred; (2) the loan contract provides for a specified annual percentage rate; (3) the licensee does both documentation of the borrower's commercial status and underwriting and obtains documentation to ensure that the prospective borrower will have sufficient monthly gross revenue with which to repay the loan terms, and does not make a loan if it determines that the prospective borrower is licensed under specified Federal law; and (4) the licensee maintains records of all compensation paid in connection with the referral of borrowers for at least four years. Declares liability for misrepresentations made to borrowers by an unlicensed person in connection with a loan. Declares that the following activities by an unlicensed person are not authorized by this Act: (1) participating in any loan negotiation; (2) counseling the borrower about a loan; (3) contacting the licensee on behalf of the borrower; (4) gathering loan documentation and delivering documentation to the licensee; (5) communicating lending decisions or inquiries to the borrower; and (6) obtaining borrower marketing materials."
"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, and under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.
Existing law provides for the county-administered In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program, under which, either through employment by the recipient, or by or through contract by the county, qualified aged, blind, and disabled persons receive services enabling them to remain in their own homes. Existing law requires the provision of personal care services under the Medi-Cal program to eligible IHSS recipients. Under existing law, county welfare departments are required to provide visually impaired applicants and recipients with information on, and referral services to, entities that provide reading services to visually impaired persons. Existing law defines “supportive services” for purposes of the IHSS program.
This bill would, commencing January 1, 2017, include within the definition of supportive services up to 2 hours per month of assistance in reading and completing financial and other documents for a recipient of services under the IHSS program who is blind. By expanding the scope of available services under the IHSS program, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require the Director of Health Care Services to seek any federal approvals necessary to ensure that Medicaid funds may be used in implementing this provision. The bill would authorize the department to implement the provision through all-county letters or similar instructions from the director until emergency regulations are filed, and would require the adoption of emergency regulations by January 1, 2018, and final regulations by January 1, 2019, to implement this provision, as specified.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code, California, to require that supportive services be provided for aged, blind, or disabled persons who cannot perform services themselves and who cannot safely remain in their homes or abodes of their own choosing. Specifies services to be included in such services."
"Existing law requires persons between 6 and 18 years of age, inclusive, to attend a public school within the school district in which the pupil’s parent or legal guardian resides, unless otherwise exempted. Existing law provides that a pupil complies with a school district’s residency requirements for school attendance in that school district if the pupil meets one of the specified requirements.
This bill would provide that a pupil complies with a school district’s residency requirements in instances where the pupil’s parent or legal guardian resides outside of the boundaries of that school district but is employed and lives with the pupil at the place of his or her employment within the boundaries of the school district for a minimum of 3 days during the school week. By requiring a school district to allow those pupils to attend a public school within the school district, thereby increasing the duties of a school district, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

"(1) Existing federal law, the
federal
Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, regulates, among other things, the quality and packaging of foods introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce and generally prohibits the misbranding of food. Existing federal law, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, governs state and local labeling requirements, including those that characterize the relationship of any nutrient specified in the labeling of food to a disease or health-related condition. Existing state law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, generally regulates misbranded food and provides that any food is misbranded if its labeling does not conform with the requirements for nutrient content or health claims as set forth in the
federal
Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the regulations adopted pursuant to that federal act. Existing law requires that a food facility, as defined, make prescribed disclosures and warnings to consumers, as specified. A violation of these provisions is a crime.
Existing state law, the Pupil Nutrition, Health, and Achievement Act of 2001, also requires the sale of only certain beverages to pupils at schools. The beverages that may be sold include fruit-based and vegetable-based drinks, drinking water with no added sweetener, milk, and in middle and high schools, an electrolyte replacement beverage if those beverages meet certain nutritional requirements.
This bill would establish the Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Safety Warning Act, which would prohibit a person from distributing, selling, or offering for sale a sugar-sweetened beverage in a sealed beverage container, or a multipack of sugar-sweetened beverages, in this state unless the beverage container or multipack bears a safety warning, as prescribed. The bill also would require every person who owns, leases, or otherwise legally controls the premises where a vending machine or beverage dispensing machine is located, or where a sugar-sweetened beverage is sold in an unsealed container to place a specified safety warning in certain locations, including on the exterior of any vending machine that includes a sugar-sweetened beverage for sale.
(2) Under existing law, the State Department of Public Health, upon the request of a health officer, as defined, may authorize the local health department of a city, county, city and county, or local health district to enforce the provisions of the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law. Existing law authorizes the State Department of Public Health to assess a civil penalty against any person in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per day, except as specified. Existing law authorizes the Attorney General or any district attorney, on behalf of the State Department of Public Health, to bring an action in a superior court to grant a temporary or permanent injunction restraining a person from violating any provision of the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law.
This bill, commencing July 1, 2016, would provide that any violation of the provisions described in (1) above, or regulations adopted pursuant to those provisions, is punishable by a civil penalty of not less than $50, but no greater than $500.
This bill would also create the Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Safety Warning Fund for the receipt of all moneys collected for violations of those provisions. The bill would allocate moneys in this fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the department for the purpose of enforcing those provisions.
The bill would make legislative findings and declarations relating to the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, obesity, and dental disease.","This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the manufacture, sale, distribution, or distribution in the state of any beverage that contains sugar, unless the beverage bears a label stating that the beverage does not contain sugar as part of the solid food source. This bill also prohibits the distribution of sugar-free beverages unless the label states that such beverages do not contain sugar as part of the solid food source."
"(1) Existing law provides that the Superintendent of Public Instruction may authorize the California School for the Deaf, which is composed of two schools, the California School for the Deaf, Northern California, and the California School for the Deaf, Southern California, to establish and maintain a testing center for deaf and hard-of-hearing minors. Existing law provides that the purpose of the center shall be to test hearing acuity and to give such other tests as may be necessary for advising parents and school authorities concerning an appropriate educational program for the child. Existing law authorizes a pupil to be referred, as appropriate, to the California School for the Deaf, among other places, for further assessment and recommendations.
This bill would require the State Department of Education’s Deaf and Hard of Hearing unit and the state’s 2 schools for the deaf to jointly select language developmental milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of developing a resource for use by parents to monitor and track deaf and hard-of-hearing children’s expressive and receptive language acquisition and developmental stages toward English literacy. The bill would require the language developmental milestones to be selected from the language developmental milestones recommended by an ad hoc advisory committee, which the bill would establish, as provided. The bill would require the parent resource to, among other things, make clear that it is not a formal assessment of language and literacy development, and that a parent’s observations of their children may differ from formal assessment data presented at an individualized family service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP) meeting, but to also make clear that a parent may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or IEP meeting for purposes of sharing their observations about their child’s development.
The bill would require the department to also select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children, as specified. The bill would authorize the educator tools or assessments to be used, in addition to the assessment required by federal law, by the child’s IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, to track deaf and hard-of-hearing children’s progress, and to establish or modify IFSP or IEP plans.
The bill would, if a child does not demonstrate progress in expressive and receptive language skills, as measured by one of the selected educator tools or assessments, or by the existing instrument used to satisfy federal law, require the child’s IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, to explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting the language developmental milestones or progressing towards them, and to recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that would be provided to assist the child’s success toward English literacy. To the extent this provision would impose additional duties on local educational agency officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill also would require the department to disseminate the language developmental milestones to parents and guardians of deaf or hard-of-hearing children, and, pursuant to federal law, to disseminate the selected educator tools and assessments to local educational agencies for use in the development and modification of IFSP and IEP plans, and to provide materials and training on its use to assist the deaf or hard-of-hearing child in becoming linguistically ready for kindergarten using both or one of the languages of American Sign Language and English.
The bill would require the department, commencing on or before July 31, 2017, and on or before each July 31 thereafter, to produce a report that is specific to language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children from birth to 5 years of age, inclusive, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing and have other disabilities, relative to their peers who are not deaf or hard of hearing, as specified. The bill would require the department to make the report available on its Internet Web site.
The bill would make these provisions applicable only to children from birth to 5 years of age, inclusive. The bill also would provide that implementation of these provisions is subject to an appropriation being made for these purposes in the annual Budget Act or another statute.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on January 8, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require the Department of Education and the California School for the Deaf to jointly select from existing standardized norms language developmental milestones for use by parents to monitor and track deaf and hard-of-hearing childrens' expressive and receptive language acquisition and developmental stages toward English literacy. The bill also requires the Department of Education to select existing tools or assessments for educators to assess the language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children."
"(1) The Public Employees’ Retirement Law (PERL) creates the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) for the purpose of providing pension benefits to specified public employees and prescribes the rights and duties of members and annuitants of the system. PERL vests management and control of PERS in the Board of Administration. The California Constitution and PERL grant the board control over the investment of the retirement fund subject to certain restrictions. PERL directs the board to invest not less than 25% of all funds that become available in a fiscal year for new investments in specified obligations and securities connected with residential realty, subject to the board’s authority to substitute other investments consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the retirement system and standards for prudent investment. PERL requires the board to report on these investments.
This bill would repeal the provisions regarding investing in residential realty, described above.
(2) PERL authorizes the board to require employers participating in the system to provide specified information, as deemed necessary by the board, for examination and copying in the course of an audit to determine the correctness of retirement benefits, reportable compensation, enrollment in the system, and reinstatement to the system.
This bill would provide that the authority described above also applies to determining the eligibility for retirement benefits.
(3) PERL requires the board to submit a quarterly review of system assets to the Legislature, which is required to include reporting on the system’s portfolio on the basis of cost and market value, among other things.
This bill would change the frequency of this report to semiannual, would eliminate the requirement to report on the investments on a cost basis, and would make other changes to the content of the report.
(4) PERL permits a member who returns to active service following an employer-approved uncompensated leave of absence, as defined, because of his or her serious illness or injury to purchase service credit for that period of absence upon the payment of contributions, as specified.
This bill would specify that the option to purchase service credit shall be elected prior to retirement, that the member be returning to state service, and would make other related and clarifying changes.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on December 19, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Repeals the requirement that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) Board of Trustees prepare and submit to the Legislature and make available to the public a report regarding the funding status of the California State and Local Retirement and Disability System and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).(Sec. 2) Allows the Board to require each state employer, school employer, and contracting agency to provide necessary information for an audit of the system. Requires the Board, before initiating an audit, to notify the subject of the estimated time required to complete the audit. Allows the Board to assess a reasonable charge upon the employer to recover additional costs incurred for the excess time to complete the audit. Prohibits a contracting agency from being assessed for delays during the course of an audit that are reasonably outside the agency's control.(Sec. 3) Requires the Board to submit to the Legislature on a semiannual basis a review of the system's assets and a report on all defined benefit trusts and defined contribution plans, including certain information. Requires the Board, upon written request from a contracting agency that does not participate in a risk pool, to also submit"
"Existing law authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to offer a program under which female inmates who are committed to state prison may be allowed to participate in a voluntary alternative custody program in lieu of confinement in state prison. Existing law defines an alternative custody program to include confinement to a residential home, a residential drug or treatment program, or a transitional care facility that offers appropriate services. Existing law provides that female inmates sentenced to determinate sentences shall be eligible for participation in the program, subject to certain disqualifying criteria.
Except as specified, existing law requires the suspension of certain Medi-Cal benefits to an individual who is an inmate of a public institution. Existing law requires the state to retain responsibility for the medical, dental, and mental health needs of individuals participating in the alternative custody program.
This bill would provide that an inmate’s existing psychiatric or medical condition that requires ongoing care is not a basis for excluding the inmate from eligibility for the program.
The bill would also prescribe specific timeframes for, among other things, the review of an application to participate in the program, notifying an applicant when a determination has been made on that application, the development of an individualized treatment and rehabilitation plan, and release of the inmate into the program. The bill would require a notice of denial to specify the reasons the inmate has been denied participation in the program, and authorize an inmate to reapply for participation in the program or appeal a denial, as specified.
The bill would also require the secretary or his or her designee to assist an individual participating in the alternative custody program in obtaining health care coverage, including, but not limited to, assistance with having suspended Medi-Cal benefits reinstated, applying for Medi-Cal benefits, or obtaining health care coverage under a private health plan or policy. The bill would require that, to the extent not covered by a participant’s health care coverage, the state would retain responsibility for the medical, dental, and mental health needs of individuals participating in the alternative custody program.","Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Secretary of Corrections and Rehabilitation to offer a program under which female inmates of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation may be allowed to participate in a voluntary alternative custody program in lieu of their confinement in State prison. Allows only those persons who meet specified criteria to participate in the program, including a current conviction for a violent felony or a serious felony and a high risk to commit a violent offense."
"Existing law designates the Division of Boating and Waterways within the Department of Parks and Recreation as the lead agency of the state for purposes of cooperating with other state, local, and federal agencies in identifying, detecting, controlling, and administering programs to manage invasive aquatic plants in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, its tributaries, and the Suisun Marsh, and prescribes the duties of the division with regard to the management and control or eradication of those plants.
This bill would require the division, no later than 90 days after the effective date of the bill, to establish, and designate and provide staff support to, an advisory and oversight committee to
evaluate and
monitor the activities of the division relating to the management and control or eradication of those plants. The bill would require the membership of the advisory and oversight committee to include an equitable number of representatives from specified interests and would require the advisory and oversight committee to meet, at a minimum, twice per year and communicate any findings or recommendations to the division.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","Declares that it is necessary that California undertake an aggressive program to control or eradicate invasive aquatic plants of the Delta, its tributaries, and Suisun Marsh in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, including the spongeplant (Limn laevigatum) in the Slough of Suisun Marsh. Authorizes the Department of Agriculture, the California Conservation Corps, commercial shipping districts, cities, counties, and other local governments to cooperate with the Department of Boating and Waterways and the other agencies in controlling water parameters of the Delta, its tributaries, and Suisun Marsh. Directs the Division of Boating and Waterways to establish an advisory and oversight committee to evaluate and monitor the activities of its management and control of invasive aquatic plants in those tributaries and of Suisun Marsh."
"(1) Under existing law, the Medical Waste Management Act, the State Department of Public Health regulates the disposal of medical waste. The act requires specified biohazard materials to be disposed of in biohazard bags and requires specified treatment for medical waste. Transportation, storage, treatment, or disposal of medical waste in a manner not authorized by the act is a crime. Existing law defines specified terms for purposes of the Medical Waste Management Act, including “biohazard bag.” Existing law defines a biohazard bag to mean a film bag that is impervious to moisture. Existing law requires the film bags that are used for transport to be marked and certified by the manufacturer as having passed specified tests prescribed for tear resistance and for impact resistance.
This bill would revise the definition of “biohazard bag” and would limit the application of the requirement that film bags used for transport be marked and certified by the manufacturer as having passed specified tests only to those film bags that are used for transport from the generator’s facility onto roadways and into commerce to a treatment and disposal facility. The bill would revise the requirements for biohazard bags that are used to collect medical waste within a facility, as specified.
(2) Existing law requires a hazardous waste transporter or generator transporting medical waste to maintain a completed shipping document in compliance with the United States Department of Transportation and a tracking document if the waste is transported to a facility other than the final medical waste treatment facility.
This bill would instead require a hazardous waste transporter that transports medical waste to maintain a tracking document in compliance with specified requirements for purposes of tracking medical waste from the point when the waste leaves the generator facility until the waste receives final treatment. The bill would also require the tracking document to be maintained only by hazardous waste transporters, and not by generators transporting waste. The bill would also make conforming changes.
(3) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Health and Safety Code, with respect to the disposal of medical waste, to require the disposable film bag used to contain medical waste to be certified by the manufacturer as having passed the tests prescribed for tear resistance in the American Society for Testing Materials. The bill also permits the Department of Health and Human Services to approve a location as a point of consolidation for the collection of home-generated sharps waste, which shall be transported and treated as medical waste. A home-generated sharps point is not subject to the requirements of this section, to the permit or registration requirements of this part, or to any permit or registration fees with regard to the activity of consolidating home-generated sharps waste. A medical waste generator required to register to the United States Postal Service (USPS) shall maintain three years individual treatment records and emergency action plans for the treatment or disposal of medical waste generated through any act or process of the generator."
"The California Constitution requires that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable. Existing law specifies the jurisdiction of the courts. Under existing law, courts may adjudicate rights to produce groundwater and exercise other powers relating to the supervision of a groundwater basin. Existing law authorizes a court to order a reference to the State Water Resources Control Board, as referee, of any and all issues involved in a suit brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state for determination of rights to water.
This bill would authorize the state to intervene in a comprehensive adjudication conducted as specified in AB 1390 of the 2015–16 Regular Session.
Existing law, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, requires all groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins by the Department of Water Resources that are designated as basins subject to critical conditions of overdraft to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2020, and requires all other groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2022, except as specified. The act authorizes a local agency to request that the department revise the boundaries of a basin.
This bill, in an adjudication action to determine rights to groundwater in a basin that is required to have a groundwater sustainability plan under the act, would require the court to manage the proceedings in a manner that minimizes interference with the timely completion and implementation of a groundwater sustainability plan, avoids redundancy and unnecessary costs in the development of technical information and a physical solution, and is consistent with the attainment of sustainable groundwater management within the timeframes established by the act. The bill would authorize an entity that is directed by the court in an adjudication action to file the request that the department revise the boundaries of a basin.
The act authorizes the state board to designate certain high- and medium-priority basins as a probationary basin if prescribed criteria are met. The act authorizes the state board to develop an interim plan for a probationary basin if the state board, in consultation with the department, determines that a local agency has not remedied a deficiency that resulted in designating the basin as a probationary basin within a certain timeframe. The act also requires the department, at least every 5 years after initial submission, to review any available groundwater sustainability plan or alternative and the implementation of the corresponding groundwater sustainability program for consistency with the act, including achieving the sustainability goal. The act requires the department to issue an assessment for each basin for which a plan or alternative has been submitted that may include recommended corrective actions to address any deficiencies identified by the department.
The bill would prohibit the provisions relating to probationary basins and interim plans from applying to a judgment approved by the court if the judgment is submitted to the department for evaluation and assessment and the department determines that the judgment satisfies the objectives of the act for the basin. The bill would require the department to submit to the court assessments and any recommended corrective actions for these judgments and would require the court, after notice and, if necessary, an evidentiary hearing, to determine whether to amend the judgment to adopt the department’s recommended corrective actions. This bill would prohibit a court from approving entry of judgment in an adjudication action for a basin required to have a groundwater sustainability plan under the act unless the court finds that the judgment will not substantially impair the ability of a groundwater sustainability agency, the board, or the department to comply with the act and to achieve sustainable groundwater management.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on November 19, 2015. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Water Code, with respect to the adjudication of groundwater rights, to authorize a local agency or an entity directed by the court in an adjudication action to file a request that the Department of the Interior revise the boundaries of a basin, including the establishment of new subbasins, if the agency or entity proposing the revision: (1) demonstrates that the proposed adjusted basin can be the subject of sustainable groundwater management; (2) consulted with interested local agencies and public water systems in the affected basins before filing the proposal; and (3) demonstrates that the entity proposing the basin boundary adjustment would limit the sustainable management of adjacent basins. The bill requires Interior, by January 1, 2016, to adopt regulations regarding the information required to comply with such subdivision, including the methodology and criteria to be used to evaluate the proposed revision."
"Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
Existing law continuously appropriates specified portions of the annual proceeds in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to various programs including 5% for the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program and 20% for the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program.
This bill would include water-borne transit as an eligible project that may be funded under these 2 programs. Because the bill would expand the allowable purposes for which the continuously appropriated funds allocated to the program may be expended, it would thereby make an appropriation.","This bill amends the Public Resources Code to revise the California Low Carbon Transit Operations Program to include projects eligible for funding pursuant to the program including: (1) intermodal, affordable housing projects that support infill and compact development; (2) transit capital projects and programs supporting transit ridership, including water-borne transit; (3) active transportation capital projects that qualify under the Active Transportation Program; (4) non-infrastructure-related active transportation projects that qualify under such Program; (5) transit-oriented development projects; (6) capital projects that implement local complete streets programs; (7) other projects or programs designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other criteria air pollutants by reducing automobile trips and vehicle miles traveled within a community; (8) acquisition of easements or other approaches or tools that protect agricultural lands that are under pressure of being converted to nonagricultural uses; and (9) planning to support implementation of a sustainable communities strategy, including implementation of local plans supporting greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts and promoting infill and compact development."
"Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district to request an emergency apportionment through the Superintendent of Public Instruction if the governing board of a school district determines during a fiscal year that its revenues are less than the amount necessary to meet its current year expenditure obligations. Existing law provides that if a school district accepts an emergency apportionment that exceeds an amount equal to 200% of the amount of the reserve recommended for that school district, as specified, the Superintendent must, among other things, assume all the legal rights, duties, and powers of the governing board of the qualifying school district, as defined, and, in consultation with the county superintendent of schools, appoint an administrator to act on the Superintendent’s behalf. Existing law authorizes the administrator to take certain actions, including, among others, revising the educational program of the qualifying school district to reflect realistic income projections and pupil performance relative to state standards.
Existing law, on or before July 1, 2014, requires the governing board of each school district and each county board of education to adopt a local control and accountability plan and requires the governing board of each school district and each county board of education to update its local control and accountability plan on or before July 1 of each year. Existing law requires the local control and accountability plan to include certain elements and requires the charter petition for a charter school to include some of those same elements.
Existing law establishes the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence for purposes of advising and assisting school districts, county superintendents of schools, and charter schools in achieving the goals set forth in a local control and accountability plan. Existing law authorizes the Superintendent to direct the collaborative to advise and assist a school district, county superintendent of schools, or charter school in specified circumstances, including upon their request.
This bill would also authorize the state-appointed administrator of a school district to request the advice and assistance of the collaborative.","Directs the governing board of a school district, before applying for an emergency apportionment in an amount identified in this Act, to discuss the need for that apportionment at a regular or special meeting of the governing board of the school district and, at that meeting, receive testimony regarding the apportionment from parents, exclusive representatives of employees of the school district, and other members of the community. Declares that the acceptance by a school district of an apportionment made pursuant to this Act that exceeds an amount equal to 200 percent of the amount of the reserve recommended for that school district under the standards and criteria adopted pursuant to Section 33127 constitutes the agreement by the school district to the conditions set forth in this Act.Exempts the Superintendent of Schools from specified administrative requirements under specified Federal law.Authorizes the Superintendent to appoint an administrator to act as administrator of the qualifying school district for up to the duration of the administratorship, subject to specified requirements."
"(1) The California Marine Resources Legacy Act establishes a program, administered by the Department of Fish and Wildlife, to allow partial removal of offshore oil structures. The act authorizes the department to approve the partial removal of offshore oil structures, if specified criteria are satisfied. The act requires the first person to file an application to partially remove an offshore oil structure to pay, in addition to other specified costs, the startup costs incurred by the department or the State Lands Commission to implement the act, including the costs to develop and adopt regulations, and requires the payment of startup costs to be reimbursed by the department, as specified. The act requires an applicant, upon conditional approval for removal, to apportion a percentage of the cost-savings funds in accordance with a prescribed schedule to specified entities and funds. The act defines “cost savings” to mean the difference between the estimated cost to the applicant of complete removal of an oil platform, as required by state and federal leases, and the estimated costs to the applicant of partial removal of the oil platform pursuant to the act.
Before the first application to partially remove an offshore oil structure is filed, this bill would authorize a prospective applicant to pay a portion of the startup costs in an amount determined by the department to be necessary for staff and other costs in anticipation of receipt of the first application. The bill would require an applicant, upon conditional approval for partial removal of an offshore oil structure, to apportion and transmit a portion of the cost savings to the department, instead of to the specified entities and funds. The bill would require the department to apportion those cost-savings funds received from the applicant in accordance with the prescribed schedule to the specified entities if certain criteria are satisfied. The bill would require the department to apportion the cost-savings funds received from
the applicant who elects to pay a portion of the startup costs before the first application is filed and who files
the first application in accordance with the prescribed schedule based on when the application was submitted rather than when the cost savings are transmitted. The bill would authorize the applicant to withdraw the application at any time before final approval and would require the department to return specified funds, including startup costs, submitted to process the application that have not been expended as of the date of receipt of the notification of withdrawal. The bill would require the department to promptly return the cost savings to the applicant if the partial removal of the offshore oil structure is not permitted by a court or governmental agency and the applicant is required to carry out full removal of the structure.
(2) Existing law requires the Natural Resources Agency to serve as the lead agency for the environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) of a proposed project to partially remove an offshore oil structure pursuant to the California Marine Resources Legacy Act. Upon certification of environmental documents pursuant to CEQA, the California Marine Resources Legacy Act requires the State Lands Commission to determine the cost savings of partial removal compared to full removal of the structure and requires the Ocean Protection Council to determine whether partial removal provides a net environmental benefit to the marine environment compared to the full removal of the structure.
This bill would instead require the commission to serve as the lead agency for the environmental review under CEQA.
The bill would require the council, in determining whether partial removal of the structure would provide a net benefit to the marine environment compared to full removal of the structure, to take certain adverse impacts to air quality and greenhouse gas emissions into account and to consult with the State Air Resources Board, among other entities. In making that determination, the bill would require the council to determine the appropriate weight to be assigned to adverse impacts to air quality and greenhouse gas emissions as compared to adverse impacts to biological resources and water quality.","This bill amends the Fish and Game Code, with respect to the environmental review of offshore oil structures, to require the California Fish and Game Department, upon receipt of an application to partially remove an offshore oil structure, to determine whether the application is complete and include all information needed by the department. Upon a determination that the application is complete, the applicant shall provide surety bonds executed by an admitted surety insurer, irrevocable letters of credit, trust funds, or other forms of financial assurances to ensure that the applicant will provide sufficient funds to the department, the California Coastal Commission, and the Conservancy to carry out all required activities, including: (1) environmental review of the proposed project; (2) a determination of net environmental benefit; (3) a determination of cost savings; (4) preparation of a management plan for the structure; (5) implementation of the management plan and ongoing maintenance of the structure after the department takes title; and (6) development of an advisory spending plan. The first person to file an application on and after January 1, 2011, to partially remove an offshore oil structure shall pay the department's startup costs."
"(1) Existing law establishes the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training within the Department of Justice. Existing law requires the commission to carry out various duties related to the education and training of peace officers, as defined.
Existing law provides that animal control officers are not peace officers but may exercise the powers of arrest of a peace officer and the power to serve warrants, as specified, during the course and within the scope of their employment, if those officers successfully complete a course in the exercise of those powers.
This bill would require every person appointed as an animal control officer prior to July 1, 2016, to complete a course in the exercise of the powers of arrest and to serve warrants no later than July 1, 2017. This bill would require every person appointed as an animal control officer, and every person appointed as a director, manager, or supervisor, or any person in direct control of an animal control agency, on or after July 1, 2016, to complete a course in the exercise of the powers of arrest and to serve warrants within one year of his or her appointment, as specified. This bill would require every animal control officer, prior to the exercise of the powers of arrest and to serve warrants, to have satisfactorily completed the required course of training.
This bill would also require every animal control officer appointed prior to July 1, 2016, to satisfactorily complete at least 40 hours of continuing education and training relating to the powers and duties of an animal control officer, no later than July 1, 2019, and every 3 years thereafter, as specified. The bill would require every animal control officer appointed on or after July 1, 2016, to comply with those requirements within 3 years of the date of his or her appointment, and every 3 years thereafter.
The bill would specify that the above training and continuing training requirements do not apply to an animal control officer who is a peace officer.
By imposing new training requirements on local employees, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law provides for the regulation and licensing of dogs, including the issuance of dog license tags. Existing law requires that fees for the issuance of dog license tags and fines collected for a violation of the provisions regulating and licensing dogs be paid into the county, city, or city and county treasury and that they be used for specified purposes, including to pay costs and expenses for the enforcement of those provisions.
This bill would expand the list of purposes for which those fees and fines shall be used to include paying for initial and in-service training for persons charged with enforcing animal control laws, including animal control officers.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill amends the Food and Agricultural Code, with respect to the issuance of dog license tags, to require all fees for the issuance of dog license tags and all fines collected pursuant to that code to be paid into the county, city, or city and county treasury. All fees for the issuance of dog license tags and all fines collected pursuant to that code shall be used to: pay fees for the issuance of dog license tags; pay fees, salaries, costs, expenses, or any or all of them for the enforcement of this division and all ordinances made pursuant to that division; pay damages to owners of livestock which are killed by dogs; pay costs of any hospitalization or emergency care of animals pursuant to the Penal Code; and pay for initial and in-service training for persons charged with enforcing animal control laws, including animal control officers."
"(1) Existing law establishes the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which health care services are provided to qualified, low-income persons. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid provisions. Existing law requires the department to develop and implement a Medi-Cal inpatient hospital reimbursement payment methodology based on diagnosis-related groups, subject to federal approval, that reflects the costs and staffing levels associated with quality of care for patients in all general acute care hospitals, as specified. Existing law generally requires the diagnosis-related group-based payments to apply to all claims.
This bill would require claims for payments pursuant to the inpatient hospital reimbursement methodology described above to be increased by
16 percent
16%
for the 2015–16 fiscal year, and would require, commencing July 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, the department to increase each diagnosis-related group payment claim amount based, at a minimum, on increases in the medical component of the California Consumer Price Index. Commencing with the 2015–16 fiscal year, and annually thereafter, the bill would require managed care rates for Medi-Cal managed care health plans to be increased by a proportionately equal amount for increased payments for hospital services.
(2) Existing law requires, except as otherwise provided, Medi-Cal provider payments to be reduced by 1% or 5%, and provider payments for specified non-Medi-Cal programs to be reduced by 1%, for dates of service on and after March 1, 2009, and until June 1, 2011. Existing law requires, except as otherwise provided, Medi-Cal provider payments and payments for specified non-Medi-Cal programs to be reduced by 10% for dates of service on and after June 1, 2011.
This bill would, instead, prohibit the application of those reductions for payments to providers for dates of service on or after June 1, 2011. The bill would also require payments for managed care health plans for dates of service following the effective date of the bill to be determined without application of some of those reductions. The bill would require the Director of Health Care Services to implement this provision to the maximum extent permitted by federal law and for the maximum time period for which the director obtains federal approval for federal financial participation for those payments.
(3) Prior law required, beginning January 1, 2013, through and including December 31, 2014, that payments for primary care services provided by specified physicians be no less than 100% of the payment rate that applies to those services and physicians as established by the Medicare program, for both fee-for-service and managed care plans.
This bill, commencing January 1, 2016, would
require, only to the extent permitted by federal law and that federal financial participation is available,
require
payments for specified medical care services to not be less than 100% of the payment rate that applies to those services as established by the Medicare program for services rendered by fee-for-service providers, and would require rates paid to Medi-Cal managed care plans to be actuarially equivalent to payment rates established by the Medicare program.
The bill, commencing January 1, 2016, would require rates paid to Denti-Cal providers for dental services provided to adults and children to be increased by the equivalent percentage as the percentage increase required for other fee-for-service Medi-Cal providers. The bill would require those provisions to be implemented only to the extent permitted by federal law and that federal financial participation is available.
The bill would authorize the department to implement those provisions through provider bulletins without taking regulatory action until regulations are adopted, and would require the department to adopt those regulations by July 1, 2018. The bill would require, commencing July 1, 2016, the department to provide a status report to the Legislature on a semiannual basis until regulations have been adopted.
(4) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill requires the Department of Health Services to develop and implement a payment methodology based on diagnosis-related groups, subject to federal approval, that reflects the costs and staffing levels associated with quality of care for patients in all general acute care hospitals in state and out of state, including Medicare critical access hospitals but excluding public hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and rehabilitation hospitals, which include alcohol and drug rehabilitation hospitals. The payment methodology shall be implemented on July 1, or on the date upon which the director of the department executes a declaration certifying that all necessary approvals have been obtained and the methodology is sufficient for formal implementation, whichever is later. Claims for payments pursuant to the payment methodology based on diagnosis-related groups shall be increased by 16% for the 2015 fiscal year. Managed care rates to Medi-Cal managed care health plans shall be increased by proportionately equal amounts for increased payments for hospital services pursuant to the payment methodology. The department shall increase each diagnosis-related group payment claim amount based, at a minimum, on increases in the medical component of the California Consumer Price Index. Commencing July 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, the department shall increase by proportionately equal amount for increased payments for hospital services"
"The Mobilehome Residency Law authorizes the management of a mobilehome park to, until January 1, 2016, file a petition for an order to enjoin a continuing or recurring violation of a reasonable rule or regulation of the mobilehome park within the limited jurisdiction of the superior court of the county in which the mobilehome community is located. Existing law, until January 1, 2016, treats these actions for injunctive relief as a limited civil case.
This bill would extend the operation of these provisions indefinitely.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 16, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.)<n><n>Amends the Civil Code, as amended by the Housing Act of 1949, to permit the management of a mobilehome park to petition the court for an order enjoining a continuing or recurring violation of any reasonable rule or regulation of the park.<n><n>Authorizes such management petition to petition for a new injunction if there has been a recurring continuous violation or there is a threat of future violations upon termination of the injunction.<n><n>Treats an action or special proceeding as a limited civil case if: (1) the amount in controversy does not exceed $25,000; (2) the relief sought is a type that may be granted in a limited civil case; and (3) the relief sought, whether in the complaint, a cross-complaint, or otherwise, is exclusively of a type that may be granted in a limited civil case."
"(1) The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The state board is required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020 and to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to achieve the maximum, technologically feasible, and cost-effective greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The act requires all state agencies to consider and implement strategies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. An executive order establishes a climate action team consisting of specified ex officio members and requires the team to make a specified biannual report to the Legislature and Governor.
This bill would establish the Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Program to be administered by the Office of Planning and Research to coordinate regional and local efforts with state climate adaptation strategies to adapt to the impacts of climate change, as specified. The bill also would require, within one year of an update to the Safeguarding California Plan, the Office of Emergency Services, in coordination with the Natural Resources Agency, the Office of Planning and Research, and relevant public and private entities, to review and update, as necessary, the Adaptation Planning Guide, as specified. The bill would establish an advisory council, as specified, to support the goals of the Office of Planning and Research as identified by the bill. The bill would require the Office of Planning and Research to establish a clearinghouse for climate adaptation information, as specified.
(2) The Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act, with specified exceptions, requires that meetings of a state body be open and public and that all persons be permitted to attend.
Existing law establishes the Strategic Growth Council and requires the council, among other things, to identify and review the activities and funding programs of member state agencies that may be coordinated to improve air and water quality. Existing law also requires the council’s meetings be open to the public and subject to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act.
This bill would specify certain council meetings that are not subject to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act.",This bill requires the Office of Planning and Research within the Department of Commerce to establish the Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Program to coordinate regional and local efforts with state climate adaptation strategies to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The program must include an emphasis on climate equity considerations across sectors and regions and strategies that benefit both greenhouse gas emissions reductions and adaptation efforts.
"Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, upon proper application, to issue driver’s licenses and identification cards.
The federal Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative facilitates travel within the western hemisphere by authorizing the use of enhanced driver’s licenses and identification cards meeting specified requirements as travel documents.
This bill would authorize the Department of Motor Vehicles to enter into a memorandum of understanding with a federal agency for the purpose of facilitating travel within the western hemisphere pursuant to the federal Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative through the issuance of an enhanced driver’s license, provisional license, or identification card. The bill would authorize the department to issue or renew, upon request, an enhanced driver’s license, provisional license, or identification card for specified persons. The bill would require a person applying for the initial issuance or renewal of an enhanced driver’s license, provisional license, or identification card to submit, under the penalty of perjury, additional proof of identity, residency, and citizenship that satisfies the requirements of the federal Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the department to provide a protective shield and to take other specified security measures for the enhanced driver’s license, provisional license, or identification card.
The bill would also require the department to submit an annual report to specified committees of the Legislature on the implementation of the enhanced driver’s license, provisional license, and identification card. The bill would require a person applying for an enhanced driver’s license, provisional license, or identification card to submit an additional application fee. The bill would require the department to set, by regulation, the application fee in an amount not to exceed the reasonable regulatory cost of issuing or renewing the license or identification card, or $55, whichever is less, and to provide specified information to the applicant. The bill would require the fees to be deposited into the Motor Vehicle Account. The bill would, upon appropriation by the Legislature, require those fees to be expended by the department in implementing the above provisions. The bill would prohibit specified information submitted by an applicant for an enhanced driver’s license, provisional license, or identification card from being disclosed by the department, as specified. The bill would make all laws related to the privacy or security of a driver’s license, provisional license, or identification document, or a similar document, or regulating the use, access or sharing of information, applicable to enhanced driver’s licenses, provisional licenses, and identification cards.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Makes it the intent of the Legislature that: (1) an employer shall not require an employee to apply for an enhanced driver's license, provisional license, or identification card as a condition of employment, or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against an employee who refuses to apply for such a license, provisional license, or identification card; and (2) a person who obtains an enhanced driver's license, provisional license, or identification card, and is a resident of the state of California, may enter into a memorandum of understanding with the state department of motor vehicles to issue such license, provisional license, or identification card."
"(1) Existing law authorizes certain persons, including, among others, any person 16 years of age or older, to have his or her proficiency in basic skills taught in public high schools verified according to criteria established by the State Department of Education. Existing law requires the State Board of Education to award a certificate of proficiency to persons who demonstrate that proficiency. Existing law requires the department to develop standards of competency in basic skills taught in public high schools and to provide for the administration of examinations prepared by, or with the approval of, the department to verify competency. Existing law authorizes the department to charge a fee for each examination application in an amount sufficient to recover the costs of administering the requirements of these provisions, but prohibits the fee from exceeding an amount equal to the cost of test renewal and administration per examination application.
This bill would prohibit the department from charging the fee to a homeless child or youth who is under 25 years of age and can verify his or her status as a homeless child or youth. The bill would authorize a homeless services provider, as defined, that has knowledge of the examinee’s housing status to verify the examinee’s status for purposes of these provisions. The bill would provide that no additional state funds shall be appropriated for purposes of implementing the above provisions. The bill would authorize the state board to adopt emergency regulations for purposes of these provisions.
(2) Existing law separately requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to issue a high school equivalency certificate and an official score report, or an official score report only, to a person who has not completed high school and who meets specified requirements, including, among others, having taken all or a portion of a general education development test that has been approved by the state board and administered by a testing center approved by the department, with a score determined by the state board to be equal to the standard of performance expected from high school graduates. Existing law authorizes the Superintendent to charge an examinee a one-time fee to pay costs related to administering these provisions and issuing a certificate, as specified. Existing law limits the amount of the fee to $20 per person and requires each scoring contractor to forward that fee to the Superintendent.
This bill would, for purposes of those provisions, prohibit a contractor or testing center that charges its own separate fee from charging that separate fee to a homeless child or youth who is under 25 years of age and can verify his or her status as a homeless child or youth. The bill would authorize a homeless services provider, as defined, that has knowledge of the examinee’s housing status to verify the examinee’s status for purposes of these provisions. The bill would provide that no additional state funds shall be appropriated for purposes of implementing these provisions, and would authorize the Superintendent to adopt emergency regulations for purposes of these provisions.
(3) Existing law establishes in the State Treasury a Special Deposit Fund Account, which consists of certain fees, and is continuously appropriated for the support of the department to be used for purposes of the provisions above relating to high school equivalency tests.
This bill would authorize the Superintendent, until July 1, 2019, to use surplus funds, as defined, in the Special Deposit Fund Account to reimburse contractors for the loss of fees, if any, pursuant to provisions above relating to high school equivalency tests. By authorizing the expenditure of money in a continuously appropriated fund for a new purpose, this bill would make an appropriation. The bill would require a contract executed by the department for the provision of those tests to require a contracting party to accept all examinees, including those entitled to a fee waiver pursuant to those provisions. The bill also would require the department to include a provision in all memorandums of understanding with contractors for purposes of providing a high school equivalency test, that if the surplus funds in the Special Deposit Fund Account are depleted, the ongoing costs of a fee waiver for an examinee deemed eligible for a waiver shall be absorbed by the contractor.
(4) This bill also would require the department, on or before December 1, 2018, to submit 2 reports to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, one relating to high school proficiency tests, and one relating to high school equivalency tests, that each include, among other things, the number of homeless youth that took a high school proficiency or equivalency test in each of the 2016, 2017, and 2018 calendar years, and the impact of the opportunity to take a high school proficiency or equivalency test at no cost on the number and percentage of homeless youth taking a high school proficiency or equivalency test.","This bill amends the Education Code to require that a person 16 years of age or older or who has been enrolled in the 10th grade for one academic year or longer, or who will complete one academic year of enrollment in the 10th grade at the end of the semester during which the next regular examination will be conducted, may have his or her proficiency in basic skills taught in public high schools verified according to criteria established by the State Department of Education. The state board shall award a certificate of proficiency to persons who demonstrate that proficiency. The certificate of proficiency shall be equivalent to a high school diploma and the department shall keep a permanent record of the issuance of all certificates. The department: (1) shall develop standards of welfare in basic skills taught in public high schools, and (2) shall provide for the administration of examinations prepared by or with the approval of the department to verify competency. Regular examinations shall be held once in the fall semester and once in the spring semester of every academic year on a date that will enable notification of examinees and the schools they attend, if any, of the results thereof not later than two weeks prior to the date on which that semester ends in a majority of school districts that maintain high welfare.

The bill would require the Secretary of State to submit to the voters at the November 8, 2016, consolidated election a voter instruction asking whether California’s elected officials should use all of their constitutional authority, including proposing and ratifying one or more amendments to the United States Constitution, to overturn Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) 558 U.S. 310, and other applicable judicial precedents, as specified. The bill would require the Secretary of State to communicate the results of this election to the Congress of the United States. The bill would require the Secretary of State, if prohibited by court order from submitting the voter instruction to the voters at the November 8, 2016, statewide general election, as specified, to submit the voter instruction to the voters at the next occurring election.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an act calling an election.","Overturn Citizens United Act This bill declares that the people of California are called to elect their elected representatives on November 8, 2016.

"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. One method by which these services are provided is pursuant to contracts with various types of managed care health plans, including through a county organized health system.
Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Knox-Keene), provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime.
Existing law provides the California Medical Assistance Commission with the authority to negotiate exclusive contracts with county organized health systems to provide health care services under the Medi-Cal program. Under existing law, the contracting counties are exempt from Knox-Keene for purposes of carrying out those contracts.
This bill would repeal that exemption and

Because a willful violation of Knox-Keene is a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 16, 2015. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Health Care Services Code and the Welfare and Institutions Code, respectively, to modify the definition of &quot;health care service plan&quot; for purposes of the requirement that insurers offer health care coverage in the individual market. Specifically, the bill applies that definition to health care service plans and specialized health care service plan contracts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may exempt from that definition any class of persons or plan contracts if the HHS Director finds the action to be in the public interest and not detrimental to the protection of subscribers, enrollees, or persons regulated under the bill and that the regulation of such persons or plan contracts is not essential to the purposes of the bill. Upon the request of HHS, the HHS Director may exempt any mental health plan contractor or capitated rate contract under the Welfare and Institutions Code. Those may be subject to conditions the HHS Director deems appropriate. The bill excludes from the definition of &quot;health care service plan&quot; a plan directly operated by a public or private institution of higher learning which directly provides health care services only to its students, faculty, staff, administration, and their respective dependents,"
"Existing law generally requires the Board of Parole Hearings to conduct youth offender parole hearings to consider the release of offenders who committed specified crimes when they were under 18 years of age and who were sentenced to state prison.
This bill would instead require the Board of Parole Hearings to conduct a youth offender parole hearing for offenders sentenced to state prison who committed those specified crimes when they were under 23 years of age. The bill would require the board to complete, by July 1, 2017, all youth offender parole hearings for individuals who were sentenced to indeterminate life terms who become entitled to have their parole suitability considered at a youth offender parole hearing on the effective date of the bill. The bill would require the board to complete all youth offender parole hearings for individuals who were sentenced to determinate terms who become entitled to have their parole suitability considered at a youth offender parole hearing on the effective date of the bill by July 1, 2021, and would require the board, for these individuals, to conduct a specified consultation before July 1, 2017.",".

"Existing federal law, the Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, provides for the integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems, commonly known as drones, into the national airspace system by September 30, 2015. Existing federal law requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to develop and implement operational and certification requirements for the operation of public unmanned aircraft systems in the national airspace system by December 31, 2015.
Existing state law generally authorizes a court to issue an order for the protection of certain persons, including, among others, the victims of domestic violence, elder and dependent adult abuse, workplace violence, and civil harassment. Under existing law, an intentional and knowing violation of those types of protective orders is a misdemeanor. If the violation results in physical injury, or occurs within specified time periods of a previous violation, existing law imposes additional penalties. Existing law also makes the crime of stalking another person, as defined, punishable as a misdemeanor or felony. Existing law makes it a felony to commit that offense when there is a temporary restraining order, injunction, or any other court order in effect prohibiting the behavior.
This bill would specifically prohibit a person subject to certain protective orders, when the person is prohibited by the protective order from coming within a specified distance of another person, from operating an unmanned aircraft system in a way that causes an unmanned aircraft, as those terms are defined, to fly within the prohibited distance of the other person, or from capturing images of the other person by using an unmanned aircraft system. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law makes certain findings and declarations regarding fire protection of the public trust resources on lands in state responsibility areas, including that the costs of fire prevention activities aimed at reducing the effects of structures in state responsibility areas should be borne by the owners of the structures.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to this law.","Amends the Penal Code and the Family Code of 1986 to increase penalties for violations of protective orders issued by a court and for subsequent violations involving physical injury to a victim. Authorizes the court, if the person is imprisoned for at least 30 days, to reduce or eliminate the six-month minimum imprisonment required. Specifies that: (1) every person who owns, possesses, purchases, or receives a firearm knowing it is prohibited from doing so under a protective order shall not be prosecuted under this Act; and (2) every person subject to a protective order shall not be prosecuted for owning, possessing, purchasing, or receiving a firearm to the extent that firearm is granted an exemption under this Act."
"Existing law, the California Public Records Act, requires state and local agencies to make their records available for public inspection, unless an exemption from disclosure applies. The act declares that access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.
This bill would require each local agency, except a local educational agency, in implementing the California Public Records Act, to create a catalog of enterprise systems, as defined, to make the catalog publicly available upon request in the office of the person or officer designated by the agency’s legislative body, and to post the catalog on the local agency’s Internet Web site. The bill would require the catalog to disclose a list of the enterprise systems utilized by the agency, and, among other things, the current system vendor and product, unless, on the facts of the particular case, the public interest served by not disclosing that information clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure, in which case the local agency may instead provide a system name, brief title, or identifier of the system. Because the bill would require local agencies to perform additional duties, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
Existing constitutional provisions require a statute that limits the right of public access to meetings or writings of public officials to be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest to be protected by that limitation and the need to protect that interest.
This bill would declare that it includes limitations on access, that the interest to be protected is the security of enterprise systems in public agencies, and that the need to protect that interest is that enterprise systems can contain information that, if released to the public, could result in negative consequences.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires local agencies, except local educational agencies, to create and post on their websites a catalog of enterprise systems, which shall be made available upon request in the office of the person or officer designated by the agency and posted on the agency's website if it has updated.

The catalog shall also disclose: (1) a list of the enterprise systems utilized by the agency and, for each system, the disclosed information; and (2) if public interest served by disclosure of the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure, the agency may instead provide a system name, brief title, or identifier of the system."
"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income persons receive health care benefits. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law provides that specified services, including targeted case management services for children with an individualized education plan (IEP) or an individualized family service plan (IFSP), provided by local educational agencies (LEAs) are covered Medi-Cal benefits, and authorizes an LEA to bill for those services. Existing law requires the department to perform various activities with respect to the billing option for services provided by LEAs. Existing law defines an LEA as the governing body of any school district or community college district, the county office of education, a state special school, a California State University campus, or a University of California campus.
This bill would require the department to seek federal financial participation for covered services that are provided by an LEA to a child who is an eligible Medi-Cal beneficiary regardless of whether the child has an IEP or an IFSP, or whether those same services are provided at no charge to the beneficiary or to the community at large, if the LEA takes all reasonable measures to ascertain and pursue claims for payment of covered services against legally liable 3rd parties. The bill would require a legally liable 3rd party to either reimburse the claim or issue a notice of denial of noncoverage of services or benefits if the legally liable 3rd party receives a claim for payment of covered services submitted by an LEA. The bill would authorize an LEA to bill the Medi-Cal program if there is no response to a claim for payment of covered services submitted to a legally liable 3rd party within 45 days, and would require the LEA to retain a copy of the claim submitted to the legally liable 3rd party for a period of 3 years. The bill would expand the definition of an LEA to include the governing body of a charter school. The bill would provide that these provisions shall not be implemented until the department obtains necessary federal approvals.
This bill would also expand the authority of an LEA to provide targeted case management services.","This bill allows local educational agencies, as a condition of enrollment to provide certain services under the Medi-Cal program, to bill for services provided on or after January 1, 1993. The funds are reimbursement for olled on or after January 1, 1993, to provide such services."
"Existing law prohibits the governing authority of a school or other institution from unconditionally admitting any person as a pupil of any public or private elementary or secondary school, child care center, day nursery, nursery school, family day care home, or development center, unless prior to his or her admission to that institution he or she has been fully immunized against various diseases, including measles, mumps, and pertussis, subject to any specific age criteria. Existing law authorizes an exemption from those provisions for medical reasons or because of personal beliefs, if specified forms are submitted to the governing authority. Existing law requires the governing authority of a school or other institution to require documentary proof of each entrant’s immunization status. Existing law authorizes the governing authority of a school or other institution to temporarily exclude a child from the school or institution if the authority has good cause to believe that the child has been exposed to one of those diseases, as specified.
This bill would eliminate the exemption from existing specified immunization requirements based upon personal beliefs, but would allow exemption from future immunization requirements deemed appropriate by the State Department of Public Health for either medical reasons or personal beliefs. The bill would exempt pupils in a home-based private school and students enrolled in an independent study program and who do not receive classroom-based instruction, pursuant to specified law from the prohibition described above. The bill would allow pupils who, prior to January 1, 2016, have a letter or affidavit on file at a private or public elementary or secondary school, child day care center, day nursery, nursery school, family day care home, or development center stating beliefs opposed to immunization, to be enrolled in any private or public elementary or secondary school, child day care center, day nursery, nursery school, family day care home, or development center within the state until the pupil enrolls in the next grade span, as defined. Except as under the circumstances described above, on and after July 1, 2016, the bill would prohibit a governing authority from unconditionally admitting to any of those institutions for the first time or admitting or advancing any pupil to the 7th grade level, unless the pupil has been immunized as required by the bill. The bill would specify that its provisions do not prohibit a pupil who qualifies for an individualized education program, pursuant to specified laws, from accessing any special education and related services required by his or her individualized education program. The bill would narrow the authorization for temporary exclusion from a school or other institution to make it applicable only to a child who has been exposed to a specified disease and whose documentary proof of immunization status does not show proof of immunization against one of the diseases described above. The bill would make conforming changes to related provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 14, 2016.

This bill, in that schedule, would consolidate the 21 loan brackets into 6 and set maximum charges within those brackets.
Existing law, among other things, limits the charge for the 4th and subsequent months of a loan to 2.5% per month on the unpaid balance, as specified.
This bill would increase the charge limit for the 4th and subsequent months to 3% per month.
Existing law permits a loan setup fee of the greater of $5 or 2% of the loan amount, not to exceed $10.
This bill would adjust the permitted loan setup fee to the greater of either $5 or 3% of the loan amount, not to exceed $30.
Existing law establishes the maximum amount, irrespective of the duration of the loan, that may be charged based on size of pawned articles, as specified, and prohibits a storage charge for any article that can be contained within one cubic foot.
This bill would permit a pawnbroker to additionally charge a maximum of $1 for handling and storage of any article that can be contained within one cubic foot.
Existing law requires a written contract that provides a 4-month loan period for every loan made by a pawnbroker for which goods are received in pledge as security and, under specified circumstances, requires a pawnbroker to notify the borrower at his or her last known address of the termination of the loan period, by a means for which verification of mailing or delivery of the notification can be provided by the pawnbroker, and provides for extending the right of redemption for a period of 10 days from the date that notice is mailed.
This bill instead would require a minimum 4-month loan period and would require the pawnbroker to provide that notification to the pledgor at his or her last known mailing or electronic address, by a means for which verification of mailing or, at the sole option of the pledgor, electronic transmission of the notification can be provided by the pawnbroker, as specified.
This bill also would require representatives of the pawnbroker industry to poll their members annually to gather data relating to the current financial condition of the California pawn industry.
Because a knowing violation of these provisions by a pawnbroker would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(Sec. 1) Prohibits a pawnbroker from charging or receiving compensation at a rate exceeding the sum of: (1) three percent per month on the unpaid principal balance of any loan; and (2) three dollars ($3) a month when the monthly charge permitted would otherwise be less.(Sec. 3) Allows a pawnbroker to charge: (1) a loan setup fee of five dollars $5; or three percent, whichever is greater, for each loan; but prohibits the maximum loan setup fee from exceeding 30 dollars ($30).(Sec. 4) Revises the schedule of charges prescribed for pawned articles to set forth: (1) a maximum amount that may be charged for handling and storage of such articles; and (2) the monthly charge for any extension of a written contract required by this section. Requires the schedule of charges to be posted in a place clearly visible to the general public.(Sec. 5) Requires every loan made by a pawnbroker for which goods are received in pledge as security to be evidenced by a written contract providing the pledgor of his or her right to redeem, at its greatest width, every article that cannot be contained within one cubic foot but can be contained within three cubic feet. Requires such loan contract to contain the following notice, at its greatest width, of the space"
"(1) Existing law establishes the Office of Health Equity within the State Department of Public Health for the purposes of aligning state resources, decisionmaking, and programs to accomplish various goals relating to health, and requires the office to perform various duties specifically relating to vulnerable communities, as defined. Existing law requires the office to establish a comprehensive, cross-sectoral strategic plan to eliminate health and mental health disparities and inequities and to seek input from the public on the plan through an inclusive public stakeholder process.
This bill would include individuals who have experienced trauma related to genocide in the definition of vulnerable communities and would require representatives from vulnerable communities to be represented in the public stakeholder process for developing the office’s plan to eliminate health and mental health disparities.
(2) Existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services to provide, to the extent resources are available, technical assistance, through its own staff, or by contract, to county mental health programs and other local mental health agencies in the areas of program operations, research, evaluation, demonstration, or quality assurance projects. Existing law requires the department, to this end, to utilize a meaningful decisionmaking process that includes, among others, stakeholders as determined by the department.
This bill would require the department to include specified stakeholders from vulnerable communities in this process, including diverse racial, ethnic, cultural, and LGBTQQ communities, communities that experience trauma related to genocide, women’s health advocates, mental health advocates, health and mental health providers, community-based organizations and advocates, academic institutions, local public health departments, local government entities, and low-income and vulnerable consumers.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code to require the State Department of Public Health to establish an Office of Health Equity to align state resources, decisionmaking, and programs to: achieve the highest level of health and mental health for all people, with special attention focused on vulnerable communities and communities that have experienced socioeconomic disadvantage and historical injustice; promote work to prevent injury and illness through improved social and environmental factors that promote health and mental health; advise and assist other state departments in their mission to increase access to, and the quality of, culturally and linguistically competent health and mental health care and services; and improve the health status of all populations and places, with a priority on eliminating health and mental health disparities and inequities. The duties of the office include: conducting policy analysis and developing strategic policies and plans regarding specific issues affecting vulnerable communities and vulnerable places to increase positive health and mental health outcomes for them and decrease health and mental health disparities and inequities; establishing a comprehensive, cross-sectoral strategic plan to eliminate health and mental health disparities and inequities; and working collaboratively with the Health in All Policies Task Force to assist state agencies and departments in developing policies, systems, programs, and environmental change strategies that have population health impacts throughout the state in order to measure and track disparities and the effectiveness of these"
"The Public Employees’ Retirement Law (PERL) creates the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) for the purpose of providing pension and other benefits to public employees, which are funded by employee and employer contributions and investment returns. PERS provides defined benefits to its members based on their final compensation, credited service, and age at retirement, subject to certain variations. Existing law provides a member with an absence due to military service or service with the uniformed services with the right to receive credit for service for the period of that absence and requires the member’s employer to contribute both the employee and employer contributions for that period if specified conditions are met.
This bill would require the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System to provide a separate and unique form to be used by a member to receive credit for his or her military service and would require the form to clearly state that the member has no obligation to pay for any portion of the employer contribution if eligibility is determined pursuant to certain provisions, as specified. The bill would require employers to both provide the member with that form and inform the member of his or her rights to receive that credit with employer-paid contributions within 30 days of the member’s return to state service and until April 1, 2017, would further require state appointing authorities to provide letters or electronic communications to all employees informing them of those rights.
Existing law authorizes a member to elect at any time prior to retirement, in accordance with regulations of the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System, to receive credit for public service, in addition to his or her current and prior service credit.
This bill would require an employer to inform a new employee at the time of hire of his or her rights to purchase service credit for certain active service, prior to the person’s first employment with that employer or entrance into the retirement system, in the Armed Forces of the United States or in the Merchant Marine of the United States, as specified.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 23, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) to require a member of the Armed Forces who is absent without leave due to military service, at the time such member begins active duty within 90 days from the effective date of his or her long-term or emergency military leave, or within 10 days after termination of military service, to be reinstated to his or her former position. The employee's tenure and civil service rights, if any, as they existed immediately before his or her military leave shall be considered as military service and termination of the state military emergency. Every appointing authority shall inform the employee of these rights prior to April 1, 2017. The bill requires the employer of a member other than a National Guard member absent compensation due to military service to contribute an amount equal to the contributions that would have been made by the employer and the employee during the absence. The employer's contribution shall be based upon the member's compensation earnable and the contribution rates in effect at the commencement of the absence, if any of the following apply: the member returns to state service within six months after receiving a discharge from military service other than dishonor"
"Existing law, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, an initiative measure enacted by the approval of Proposition 215 at the November 5, 1996, statewide general election, authorizes the use and cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes. Existing law makes it a crime to plant, cultivate, harvest, dry, or process marijuana, except as otherwise authorized by law. Under existing law, qualified patients, persons with valid identification cards, and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients and persons with identification cards, who associate in order collectively and cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, are not subject to criminal sanctions solely on the basis of that fact.
This bill would state that it is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that imposes an excise tax on medical marijuana at the point of sale.
(1)Existing law provides for financial and food assistance benefits to needy Californians including, among other programs, the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program and CalFresh, under which each county provides for financial and food assistance benefits to qualified individuals who meet specified eligibility criteria.
This bill would require the State Department of Social Services to develop and make available to the Statewide Automated Welfare System an electronic verification process that allows county human services agency eligibility workers to, at their option, access data available electronically from public and private agencies and programs for use in connection with the determination of eligibility for specified means-tested public benefit programs.
(2)Existing federal law provides for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known in California as CalFresh, formerly the Food Stamp Program, under which supplemental nutrition assistance benefits allocated to the state by the federal government are distributed to eligible individuals by each county. Under existing law, county human services agencies administer CalFresh.
Existing law requires each county human services agency, to the extent permitted by federal law, to exempt a household from complying with face-to-face interview requirements at initial application and recertification, and authorizes a person eligible for an exemption from the face-to-face interview requirement to request a face-to-face interview to establish initial eligibility or comply with recertification requirements.
This bill would instead require a county human services agency to conduct a telephone interview for purposes of determining eligibility at initial application and recertification, except as provided, and would require a county human services agency to facilitate submission of required documents using electronic and telephone technologies to the greatest extent possible. The bill would also expand the circumstances under which a face-to-face interview is required, and would authorize an electronic interview to be conducted if the county human services agency and the applicant or recipient both have the capacity to participate in an electronic interview. The bill would require the department to issue guidance for recording and storing electronic and telephonic signatures. By increasing the duties of county human services agencies administering CalFresh, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require the State Department of Social Services to coordinate with county human services agencies to make available a standard technological solution that has the capacity to store telephonic and electronic signatures, as specified.
(3)The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on October 16, 2011. The summary of that version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services, in order to ensure timely and accurate decisions on applications for means-tested public benefit programs under the Medicaid program, to develop and make available to the Statewide Automated Welfare System an electronic verification process that allows county human services agency eligibility workers to access electronically from appropriate public and private agencies and programs for use in connection with the determination of eligibility for such programs. The electronic verification process shall be completed no later than the expiration of the federal waiver for Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87, which requires states to evenly allocate the development costs for systems that are federally funded. The bill also requires the department to report to the Legislature regarding the ways in which the electronic verification process guarantees the rights established under these laws to protect individuals from negative actions resulting from incorrect information. The bill requires: (1) each county human services agency to conduct a telephone interview for purposes of determining eligibility at initial application and recertification and facilitate submission of required documents using electronic and telephone technologies, except for face-to-face interviews that are deemed necessary to clarify a condition of eligibility or that are required to make timely"
"(1) Existing law regulates pawnbrokers and requires a written contract for every loan by a pawnbroker for which goods are received in pledge as security, as specified, and requires a copy of that contract to be furnished to the borrower. Existing law requires the contract to provide a 4-month loan period.
This bill would, instead, specify that the contract be for a minimum of 4 months.
(2) Existing law requires a pawnbroker, within one month after the loan period expires, to notify the borrower at his or her last known address of the termination of the loan period, by a means for which verification of mailing or delivery of the notification can be provided by the pawnbroker, and provides for extending the right of redemption for a period of 10 days from the date that notice is mailed.
This bill would instead require the pawnbroker to provide that notification to the pledgor at his or her last known mailing or electronic address, by a means for which verification of mailing or, at the sole option of the pledgor, electronic transmission of the notification can be provided by the pawnbroker, as specified. The bill would provide that the electronic notice of the termination of the loan period would be valid only if the pledgor has previously responded to an electronic communication sent by the pawnbroker to the pledgor’s last known electronic address and would require the pledgor to affirm the electronic address on file, as prescribed.
(3) Existing law permits a pledgor and a pawnbroker to agree to a new loan to become effective at the end of the loan period and requires the new loan to be processed as a new loan subject to loan origination, storage, and other fees as specified.
This bill would permit a replacement loan to be issued at the request of the pledgor with consent of the pawnbroker before the expiration of the redemption period, to become effective on the date it is issued, subject to specified requirements, including, but not limited to, that the pledgor pay off all outstanding charges from the prior loan then due before a replacement loan may be issued. The bill would also permit the replacement loan to be issued electronically, provided that the contract and transaction comply with the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act and meet certain disclosure requirements.","(Sec. 1) This bill expresses the intent of the State of California to permit pawnbrokers to conduct business transactions by electronic means, except when establishing an original loan. It is further intent of the State to permit such transactions to be made in conformity with the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. (Sec. 2) Every loan made by a pawnbroker for which goods are received in pledge as security shall be evidenced by a written contract, a copy of which shall be furnished to the pledgor. The loan contract shall provide a loan period that is a minimum of four months, shall set forth the loan period and the date on which the loan is due and payable, and shall clearly inform the pledgor of his or her right to redeem the pledge during the loan period. It is further intent of the State to permit such transactions to be made in conformity with the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. (Sec. 3) The Financial Code is amended to require that: (1) every loan contract made by a pawnbroker for which goods are received in pledge as security shall be evidenced by a written contract, a copy of which shall be furnished to the pledgor; (2) every pawnbroker shall retain in his or her possession every article pledged to him or her for the duration of the loan period"
"Existing law contains provisions governing the operation and financing of community mental health services for the mentally disordered in every county through locally administered and locally controlled community mental health programs.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to the latter provisions.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to state that the primary goal of the use of funds deposited in the mental health account of the local health and welfare trust fund should be to serve the target populations identified in the following categories, which shall not be construed as establishing an order of priority: (1) seriously emotionally disturbed children or adolescents; (2) adults and older adults who have a serious mental disorder; and (3) veterans who may be eligible for mental health services through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs."
"Existing law requires, in all cases in which a criminal defendant is convicted of specified crimes, including any crime for which the defendant must register as a sex offender, the court to consider issuing an order, valid for up to 10 years, restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim. Existing law authorizes the order to be issued by the court regardless of whether the defendant is sentenced to state prison or a county jail, or whether the imposition of sentence is suspended and the defendant is placed on probation.
This bill would additionally authorize the order to be issued by the court regardless of whether the defendant is subject to mandatory supervision.","Amends the Family Code and the Federal criminal code to permit a court with jurisdiction over a criminal matter, upon a good cause belief that harm to, or intimidation or dissuasion of, a victim or witness has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur, to issue orders, including, but not limited to: (1) an order that a defendant shall not violate specified provisions of the Code (prohibiting the defendant from entering the courtroom without the consent of the law enforcement agency); (2) an order that a person before the court other than a defendant, including a subpoenaed witness or other person entering the courtroom, shall not violate any such provisions; (3) an order that such a person shall have no communication whatsoever with a specified witness or a victim, except through an attorney under reasonable restrictions that the court may impose; (4) an order calling for a hearing to determine if such an order should be issued; and (5) an order that a particular law enforcement agency within the jurisdiction of the court provide protection for a victim or a witness, or both, or for immediate family members of a victim or a witness who reside in the same household as the victim or witness or within reasonable proximity of them.

"Existing law provides that it is the intent of the Legislature that in providing child development programs the Superintendent of Public Instruction give priority to children of families that qualify under applicable federal statutes or regulations as recipients of public assistance and other low-income and disadvantaged families. Existing law authorizes the City and County of San Francisco, until July 1, 2016, and as a pilot project, to develop and implement an individualized county child care subsidy plan, as provided. Existing law requires the Superintendent to administer all California state preschool programs, which include part-day age and developmentally appropriate programs for 3- and 4-year-old children, as provided. Existing law provides that 3- and 4-year-old children are eligible for the state part-day preschool program if the family meets one of several eligibility requirements, including income eligibility.

"Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish a program of public health nursing in the child welfare services program, and requires counties to use the services of the foster care public health nurse under this program. Existing law requires the foster care public health nurse to perform specified duties, including participating in medical care planning and coordinating for a child in foster care.
This bill would authorize a foster care public health nurse, as part of his or her requirement to participate in medical care planning and coordinating for a child, to monitor and oversee the child’s use of psychotropic medications. The bill would also require a foster care public health nurse to assist a nonminor dependent to make informed decisions about his or her health care. By imposing this additional duty on foster care public health nurses, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law restricts the disclosure of medical and mental health information by providers of health care and mental health care services, but authorizes disclosure of this information to county social workers, probation officers, or any other person who is legally authorized to have custody and care of a minor who is in temporary custody or subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, for the purpose of coordinating medical treatment and health care, mental health, and developmental disability services for the minor.
This bill would authorize the disclosure of this health care and mental health care information to a foster care public health nurse, as specified.
This bill would incorporate changes to Section 16501.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and SB 238, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.

"Existing law prohibits a pupil enrolled in a public school from being required to pay a pupil fee for participation in an educational activity. Existing law authorizes a complaint of noncompliance to be filed with the principal of a school for violation of that prohibition, as specified, and required public schools to establish local policies and procedures to implement the complaint provisions.
This bill would prohibit a public school from establishing a local policy or procedure that authorizes the public school to resolve a complaint by providing a remedy to the complainant without also providing a remedy to all affected pupils, parents, and guardians, as provided. The bill would authorize the Superintendent of Public Instruction to ensure that an appeal that the State Department of Education finds merit in is resolved in a timely manner, as specified.

"Under existing law, the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act, a penalty of $4 is imposed upon every conviction for a violation of the Vehicle Code, or a local ordinance adopted pursuant to the Vehicle Code, other than a parking offense. Existing law requires the county or the court that imposed the fine to transfer the moneys collected pursuant to this act to the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act Fund. Under existing law, the assessment of these penalties will terminate on January 1, 2016, and any moneys unexpended and unencumbered in the Emergency Medical Air Transportation Act Fund on June 30, 2017, will transfer to the General Fund.

"Existing law regulates the hiring of dwelling units, as defined. Existing law requires a landlord of a residential dwelling unit to provide a new tenant with certain disclosures, including, but not limited to, specified notice from a registered structural pest control company regarding the use of pesticides at the dwelling unit if a contract for periodic pest control service has been executed.
This bill, with certain exceptions, would require the landlord or the landlord’s authorized agent, as defined, to provide a tenant, and, if certain conditions are met, any tenant of adjacent units, with specified notice of the use of pesticides at the dwelling unit if the landlord or authorized agent applies any pesticide without a licensed pest control operator.
The bill, with certain exceptions, would require the posting of a similar notice at least 24 hours prior to application of any pesticide to a common area without a licensed pest control operator, unless the pest poses an immediate threat to health and safety, in which case the notice would be required to be posted as soon as practicable, but not later than one hour after the pesticide is applied. For routine application pursuant to a schedule in common areas, the bill would require a notification to existing tenants prior to the initial routine application and to new tenants at the time that the lease agreement is entered into.","Requires owners or authorized agents of residential rental property to provide tenants with written notification prior to the application of a pesticide, including: (1) the pest to be targeted; (2) the pesticide to be used; (3) the frequency of use; (4) the health and safety statement required under existing law; and (5) the name and brand of the proposed pesticide and the statements that could reasonably be provided by any authorized agent."
"(1) Existing law prohibits Members of the Legislature, and state, county, district, judicial district, and city officers or employees from being financially interested in a contract, as specified, made by them in their official capacity or by any body or board of which they are members, subject to specified exceptions. Existing law identifies certain remote interests that are not subject to this prohibition and other situations in which an official is not deemed to be financially interested in a contract, including, among others, that of a parent in the earnings of his or her minor child for personal services. Existing law makes a willful violation of this prohibition a crime.
This bill would, on and after January 1, 2017, instead include within the definition of remote interests that of a public officer who is an elected member of any state or local body, board, or commission, if that public officer’s spouse, child, parent, sibling, or the spouse of the child, parent, or sibling, has a financial interest in any contract made by that public officer in his or her official capacity, or by any body, board, or commission of which that public officer is a member.
(2) Existing law imposes a criminal penalty for every officer or person who willfully violates the prohibitions against making or being financially interested in contracts, as specified.
This bill would additionally provide that a member who knows and fails to disclose his or her remote interest in a contract, as defined, or knows and willfully fails to disclose the fact of his or her remote interest in a contract, as defined, is subject to criminal penalty.
By expanding these prohibitions, this bill would create a new crime, and thus, would impose a state-mandated local program.

This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Prohibits State and local government officers from being deemed to be interested in contracts entered into by body or board of which they are members if the officer has only a remote interest and if that interest is disclosed to such body or board, and thereafter the body or board authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract in good faith by a vote of its membership sufficient for the purpose without counting the vote or votes of the officer or member with the remote interest. Defines, for purposes of this Act, the term ""remote interest"" to mean: (1) that of an officer or employee of a nonprofit entity or a nonprofit corporation; (2) that of an employee or agent of the contracting party if the contracting party has ten or more other employees and if the officer was an employee or agent of that contracting party for at least three years prior to the officer accepting his or her office and the officer owns less than three percent of the stock of the contracting party; and (3) that of an employee or agent of the contracting party if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the agency of which the person is an officer is a local public agency located in a county with a population of less than 4 million; (2) the contract is competitively bid and is not for personal services; (3) the employee"
"Existing law relating to public contracts requires local agencies, including cities and counties, to comply with specified procedures for public contracting for public construction.
The Meyers-Milias-Brown Act requires the governing body of a local public agency to meet and confer in good faith regarding wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment with representatives of a recognized employee organization.
This bill would enact the Civic Reporting Openness in Negotiations Efficiency Act to establish specific procedures for the negotiation and approval of certain contracts valued at $250,000 or more for goods or services by cities, counties, cities and counties, or special districts that have adopted a civic openness in negotiations ordinance, or COIN ordinance, defined as an ordinance imposing specified requirements as part of any collective bargaining process undertaken pursuant to the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act. The act would require the designation of an independent auditor to review and report on the cost of any proposed contract. The act would require a city, county, city and county, or special district to disclose prescribed information relating to the contract and contract negotiations on its Internet Web site. The act would prohibit a final determination by the governing body regarding approval of any contract until the matter has been heard at a minimum of 2 public meetings of the governing body.
The act would exempt from its provisions contracts required to respond to, recover from, or mitigate the effects of a temporary public safety emergency declared by the chief law enforcement officer of a city, county, city and county, or special district, or a state of war emergency, state of emergency, or local emergency, as those terms are defined in the California Emergency Services Act. The act would also exempt from its provisions a renewal of a contract if the employees performing the services are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that is governed by the National Labor Relations Act.
By imposing new requirements on cities, counties, cities and counties, and special districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Makes this Act inapplicable to a contract if the contract is required to respond to, recover from, or mitigate the effects of: (1) a temporary public safety emergency declared by the chief law enforcement officer of a city, county, or special district; (2) a state of war emergency, state of emergency, or local emergency, as those terms are defined in the Government Code; or (3) a state of war emergency, state of emergency, or local emergency, as those terms are defined in the Government Code. Provides that this Act shall not apply to a renewal of a contract if the employees performing the services are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that governed by the National Labor Relations Act. Requires the city, county, city and county or special district to designate an unbiased independent auditor to prepare a report on the cost of the contract and provide it to the governing body before any action is taken to approve or disapprove the contract. Requires the report to include a recommendation regarding the viability of the contract within the fiscal year of the city, county, city and county, or special district, and to determine the cost of any proposed contract based on, and determine the viability of, each term and condition of the contract."
"(1) Existing law requires a school district to provide access to free, fresh drinking water during meal times in school food service areas, unless the governing board of a school district adopts a resolution stating that it is unable to comply with this requirement and demonstrating the reasons why it is unable to comply due to fiscal constraints or health and safety concerns. Existing law requires the resolution to be publicly noticed on at least 2 consecutive meeting agendas and approved by at least a majority of the governing board of the school district.
This bill would delete the provision authorizing a school district to adopt a resolution stating that it is unable to provide access to free, fresh drinking water during meal times. The bill would instead specify that a school district shall provide access to free, fresh, and clean drinking water during meal times through the use of drinking water access points, as defined. By imposing additional duties on school districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would require a school district that has drinking water sources with drinking water that does not meet the United States Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards for lead or any other contaminant to close access to those drinking water sources, to provide alternative drinking water sources, as specified, and to notify specified persons if the school district is required to provide those alternative drinking water sources. By imposing additional duties on pupil schools and school districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Under existing law, known as the Lead-Safe Schools Protection Act, the State Department of Public Health is required to perform various activities related to reducing the risk of exposure to lead hazards in public schools, including, among other activities, working with the State Department of Education to develop voluntary guidelines to ensure that lead hazards are minimized in the course of school repair and maintenance programs and abatement procedures.
This bill would repeal the requirement that the State Department of Public Health develop voluntary guidelines. The bill would instead require the State Department of Education to make information available to school districts about the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s technical guidance for reducing lead in drinking water in schools. The bill would prohibit drinking water that does not meet the United States Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards for lead from being provided at a school facility. The bill would require a public school that has lead-containing plumbing components to flush all drinking water sources at the beginning of each schoolday, except as provided. By imposing additional duties on public schools and school districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to require the Department of Education, with respect to lead in drinking water in schools, to make information available on its website or through any other means for distributing information it deems effective. (Sec. 2) The Department of Public Health must: design and implement a strategy for identifying the characteristics of high-risk schools and provide a basis estimates of the presence of lead in schools attended by young children; conduct a sample survey to determine the likely extent and distribution of lead exposure to children from paint on the school, soil in play areas at the school, drinking water at the tap, and other potential sources identified by the Department for this purpose; compile and report survey results to the Legislature and the Department; notify the principal of the school or director of the school of the survey results; notify the teachers and other school personnel and parents of the survey results; make recommendations to the Legislature and the Department based on the survey results and consideration of appropriate federal and state standards, on the feasibility and necessity of conducting statewide lead testing and any additional action needed relating to lead contamination in the schools; develop environmental lead testing methods and standards to ensure the scientific integrity of results; and evaluate the most current cost-"
"Existing law, the Physician Assistant Practice Act, provides for regulation of physician assistants and authorizes a physician assistant to perform medical services as set forth by regulations when those services are rendered under the supervision of a licensed physician and surgeon, as specified. The act requires the supervising physician and surgeon to review, countersign, and date a sample consisting of, at a minimum, 5% of the medical records of patients treated by the physician assistant functioning under adopted protocols within 30 days of the date of treatment by the physician assistant. The act requires the supervising physician and surgeon to select for review those cases that by diagnosis, problem, treatment, or procedure represent, in his or her judgment, the most significant risk to the patient. A violation of those supervision requirements is a misdemeanor.
This bill would require that the medical record for each episode of care for a patient identify the physician and surgeon who is responsible for the supervision of the physician assistant. The bill would delete those medical record review provisions, and, instead, require the supervising physician and surgeon to use one or more of described review mechanisms. By adding these new requirements, the violation of which would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program by changing the definition of a crime.
The act authorizes a physician assistant, while under prescribed supervision of a physician and surgeon, to administer or provide medication to a patient, or transmit orally, or in writing on a patient’s record or in a drug order, an order to a person who may lawfully furnish the medication or medical device. The act prohibits a physician assistant from administering, providing, or issuing a drug order to a patient for Schedule II through Schedule V controlled substances without advance approval by a supervising physician and surgeon for that particular patient unless the physician assistant has completed an education course that covers controlled substances and that meets approved standards. The act requires that the medical record of any patient cared for by a physician assistant for whom a physician assistant’s Schedule II drug order has been issued or carried out to be reviewed, countersigned, and dated by a supervising physician and surgeon within 7 days.
This bill would establish an alternative medical records review mechanism, and would authorize the supervising physician and surgeon to use the alternative mechanism, or a sample review mechanism using a combination of the 2 described mechanisms, as specified, to ensure adequate supervision of the administration, provision, or issuance by a physician assistant of a drug order to a patient for Schedule II controlled substances.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to permit a physician assistant, notwithstanding any other law, to perform medical services under the supervision of a licensed physician and surgeon who is not subject to a disciplinary condition imposed by the Medical Board of California prohibiting that supervision or prohibiting the employment of a physician assistant. The medical record for each episode of care for a patient shall identify the physician and surgeon who is responsible for the supervision of the physician assistant. (Currently, such a physician assistant may assist a doctor of podiatric medicine who is a partner, shareholder, or employee in the same medical group as the supervising physician and surgeon.) Requires the supervising physician and surgeon to establish written guidelines for the adequate supervision of the physician assistant."

"Existing law requires each party to a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation to serve on the other party a preliminary declaration of disclosure of assets, as specified, and a final declaration of disclosure, as specified. Existing law requires each party to serve a preliminary declaration of disclosure either concurrently with the petition for dissolution, or within 60 days of filing the petition for dissolution of marriage. Existing law specifies, in the case of a default judgment, that a petitioner shall not be required to serve or receive a final declaration of disclosure, but a preliminary declaration of disclosure by the petitioner is still required.
This bill would provide that a preliminary declaration of disclosure is not required by a petitioner if the petitioner served the summons and petition by publication or posting pursuant to court order and the respondent has defaulted. The bill would require, when a petitioner has served the summons and petition by publication or posting pursuant to court order and the respondent files a response prior to default judgment being entered, the petitioner to serve the respondent with a preliminary declaration of disclosure within 30 days of the response being filed. The bill would make other related, conforming changes.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Family Code to provide that, in order to provide full and accurate disclosure of all assets and liabilities in which one or both parties may have an interest, each party to a proceeding for dissolution of the marriage or legal separation of the parties shall serve on the other party a preliminary declaration of disclosure, unless service of the preliminary declaration is not required pursuant to specified provisions of the Code, and a final declaration of disclosure is waived pursuant to such provisions, and shall file proof of service of each with the court.

Existing law, the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009, provides for the regulation of private postsecondary educational institutions by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education in the Department of Consumer Affairs. The act exempts an institution from its provision if any of a list of specific criteria are met.
This bill, commencing January 1, 2018, would remove the exemption from the provisions of the act for an institution that is certified by the Department of Motor Vehicles to offer a course of instruction to prepare students to obtain a commercial driver’s license, thereby making the act applicable to the institution.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on October 16, 2017.

"(1) Existing law, the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety and related statutes, requires that certain specified felonies be punished by a term of imprisonment in a county jail for 16 months, or 2 or 3 years, and provides for postrelease community supervision by county officials for persons convicted of certain specified felonies upon release from prison or county jail. As part of the realignment of public safety services to local agencies, existing law establishes the Local Revenue Fund 2011 into which specified tax revenues are deposited and are continuously appropriated for the provision of public safety services, as defined.
This bill, the 2015 Realignment Legislation addressing justice reinvestment, would establish the Realignment Reinvestment Fund in the State Treasury as a continuously appropriated fund. The bill would require the Director of Finance, in consultation with the Legislative Analyst, to annually calculate the net savings to the state for the prior fiscal year and an estimate of the net current fiscal year savings resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, as specified. The bill would require the Controller to transfer $1,543,783,000 from the General Fund to the Realignment Reinvestment Fund for the 2015–16 fiscal year, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would, beginning in the 2016–17 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, require the Controller to transfer an amount equal to the estimate of net current fiscal year savings resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, adjusted by the difference between the preceding year’s estimate and the calculated prior fiscal year net savings, thereby making an appropriation.
The bill would require the Controller to annually allocate moneys in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund, no later than September 1 of each year, to each county for deposit in the county’s Realignment Reinvestment Services Account proportionally, based on the average daily population of realigned offenders under each county’s supervision for the preceding fiscal year. The bill would require the Controller to consult with the Board of State and Community Corrections to determine the average daily population for each county.
The bill would require a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account to be established in each county treasury. The bill would require the moneys to implement a comprehensive, locally run, supplemental community-based corrections plan, as specified. The bill would require the supplemental community-based corrections plan to be developed by each county’s local Community Corrections Partnership and to be voted on by an executive committee of each county’s Community Corrections Partnership, as specified.

Existing law, the Joint Exercise of Powers Act, generally authorizes 2 or more public agencies, by agreement, to jointly exercise any common power, which may include hiring employees and establishing retirement systems. PEPRA authorizes a joint powers authority formed by the Cities of Brea and Fullerton on or after January 1, 2013, to provide employees who are not new members under PEPRA with the defined benefit plan or formula that was received by those employees from their respective employers on December 31, 2012, if they are employed by the joint powers authority without a break in service of more than 180 days.

"Existing law regulates the payment of compensation to employees by employers and prohibits an employer from conditioning employment on requiring an employee to refrain from disclosing the amount of his or her wages, signing a waiver of the right to disclose the amount of those wages, or discriminating against an employee for making such a disclosure.
Existing law generally prohibits an employer from paying an employee at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex in the same establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions. Existing law establishes exceptions to that prohibition where the payment is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production, or a differential based on any bona fide factor other than sex. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for an employer or other person acting either individually or as an officer, agent, or employee of another person to pay or cause to be paid to any employee a wage less than the rate paid to an employee of the opposite sex as required by these provisions, or who reduces the wages of any employee in order to comply with these provisions.
This bill would revise that prohibition to eliminate the requirement that the wage differential be within the same establishment, and instead would prohibit an employer from paying any of its employees at wage rates less than those paid to employees of the opposite sex for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort, and responsibility, as specified. The bill would revise and recast the exceptions to require the employer to affirmatively demonstrate that a wage differential is based upon one or more specified factors, including a seniority system, a merit system, a system that measures earnings by quantity or quality of production, or a bona fide factor other than sex, as specified. The bill would also require the employer to demonstrate that each factor relied upon is applied reasonably, and that the one or more factors relied upon account for the entire differential. The bill would prohibit an employer from discharging, or in any manner discriminating or retaliating against, any employee by reason of any action taken by the employee to invoke or assist in any manner the enforcement of these provisions. The bill would authorize an employee who has been discharged or discriminated or retaliated against, in the terms and conditions of his or her employment because the employee engaged in any conduct delineated in these provisions, to recover in a civil action reinstatement and reimbursement for lost wages and work benefits caused by the acts of the employer, including interest thereon, as well as appropriate equitable relief. The bill would prohibit an employer from prohibiting an employee from disclosing the employee’s own wages, discussing the wages of others, inquiring about another employee’s wages, or aiding or encouraging any other employee to exercise his or her rights under these provisions. The bill would also increase the duration of employer recordkeeping requirements from 2 years to 3 years. By changing the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Labor Code to revise the prohibition against sex-based discrimination in the payment of wages. The bill prohibits an employer from paying any employee less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex for substantially similar work, except where the employer demonstrates that: (1) the wage differential is based upon one or more specified factors, such as merit systems or systems that measure earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (2) the factor is not overriding a legitimate business necessity such that the factor would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. Any employee may file a complaint with the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement alleging payment of wages in violation of this bill. The division shall: (1) investigate such complaints, and (2) keep confidential the name of any employee who submits a complaint."
"(1) Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary education in this state, and authorizes local educational agencies throughout the state to provide instruction to pupils.
This bill would enact the California Mathematics Placement Act of 2015. The bill would require governing boards or bodies of local educational agencies, as defined, that serve pupils entering grade 9 and that have not adopted a fair, objective, and transparent mathematics placement policy as of January 1, 2016, to, before the beginning of the 2016–17 school year, develop and adopt, in a regularly scheduled public meeting, a fair, objective, and transparent mathematics placement policy for pupils entering grade 9 with specified elements, and would authorize governing boards or bodies of local educational agencies serving pupils who are transitioning between elementary and middle school or elementary and junior high school to develop and implement a mathematics placement policy for these pupils, as applicable, with these specified elements. The bill would further require each governing board or body of a local educational agency to ensure that its mathematics placement policy is posted on its Internet Web site. By imposing additional requirements on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

"(1) Existing law, the Cannella Environmental Farming Act of 1995, requires the Department of Food and Agriculture to establish and oversee an environmental farming program to provide incentives to farmers whose practices promote the well-being of ecosystems, air quality, and wildlife and their habitat. The act requires the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to convene a 5-member Scientific Advisory Panel on Environmental Farming for the purpose of providing advice and assistance to federal, state, and local government agencies on issues relating to air, water, and wildlife habitat, as specified.
This bill instead would authorize, rather than require, the environmental farming program to provide incentives, including loans, grants, research, technical assistance, or educational materials and outreach, to farmers whose practices promote the well-being of ecosystems, air quality, and wildlife and their habitat, and reduce on-farm greenhouse gas emissions or increase carbon storage in agricultural soils and woody biomass, or both. The bill would rename the panel the Environmental Farming Science Advisory Panel and revise the panel’s membership and duties, as specified. The bill would require the panel to provide a biennial report describing its work to the Legislature and the Governor, among others.
The bill would provide that $25,000,000 shall be made available to the department, upon appropriation, from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to support projects to demonstrate agricultural management practices and activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon storage in agricultural soils and woody biomass, as specified. The bill would require the department, in consultation with the panel, to develop and implement a grant program to carry out the purposes of the act and would require the State Air Resources Board, in consultation with the secretary and the panel, to consider and recommend, as appropriate, the use of available tools to demonstrate and quantify greenhouse gas emissions reductions from the grant program.
(2) The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The act authorizes the state board to include the use of market-based compliance mechanisms. Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the state board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Existing law continuously appropriates 20% of the annual proceeds of the fund to the Strategic Growth Council for the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program, as provided.
This bill would require the council, no later than the 2015–16 fiscal year, to establish and administer a grant program, as part of the Sustainable Agricultural Lands Conservation Program established by the council in conjunction with the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program, to provide financial incentives for the adoption and use of land management practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sequester carbon in soil and woody biomass, and provide other cobenefits on working agricultural operations, as specified.
The bill would continuously appropriate 2% of the annual proceeds of the fund to the Strategic Growth Council to be expended for agricultural land protection consistent with the provisions of that grant program, thereby making an appropriation.","This bill amends the Food and Agricultural Code to require the Department of Food and Agriculture (USDA) to establish an environmental farming program that may provide incentives, including loans, grants, research, technical assistance, or educational materials and outreach, to promote farmers whose practices create air quality, and wildlife and their habitat, and reduce on-farm greenhouse gas emissions or increase carbon storage in agricultural soils and woody biomass.

The summary of that version is repeated here.) California Workplace Flexibility Act of 2015 (Sec. 2) This bill declares that it is the intent of the Legislature in California to protect workers by allowing an employee to request a flexible work schedule of up to four 10-hour days per week without receiving overtime pay, but, instead, he or she may request a flexible work schedule of up to four 10-hour days per week and the employer may agree to this schedule without having to pay overtime for the 9th and 10th hours worked per day in that schedule. The employer will be required to pay overtime rates after 10 work hours in a day for workers who have chosen a flexible schedule pursuant to this bill. The worker, including one who chooses a flexible schedule under this bill, will receive overtime for any hours worked over 40 hours in a single week.

The bill would authorize the state board to implement, interpret, or make specific these provisions by means of criteria, published on its Internet Web site. To the extent that a public water system, when requesting approval of a compliance plan or submitting a report pursuant to these provisions, would make any false statement or representation, this bill would expand the scope of a crime and impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code to allow the state of California to extend the period of time for public water systems to comply with drinking water standards for hexavalent chromium until the systems comply with such standards by the earliest feasible date. A compliance plan must include: (1) a compelling reason why it is not feasible for the systems to comply with the standards presently; (2) a summary of the systems' review of available funding sources, the best available technology or technologies for treatment, and other options to achieve and maintain compliance with the standards by the earliest feasible date; and (3) a description of the actions the systems are taking and will take by milestone dates to comply with such standards by the earliest feasible date. The state board may approve a compliance plan either prior to January 1, 2020, or prior to January 1, 2021. The system must provide written notice to persons served by it at least two times a year regarding the plan, including notice of: (1) that the system is implementing the plan approved by the state board, and (2) that demonstrates the system is taking the needed feasible actions to comply with the standards. The system must also submit a written status report that specifies any changes to the plan that specifies changes to the standards that are needed to achieve compliance."
"(1) Existing law, the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, makes unlawful certain unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer, including, among other things, advertising or promoting any event, presentation, seminar, workshop, or other public gathering regarding veterans’ benefits or entitlements that does not include a specified statement. Existing law authorizes any consumer who suffers damages as a result of the use or employment by any person of a method, act, or practice declared to be unlawful, as described above, to bring an action against that person to recover or obtain damages, restitution, an order enjoining the methods, acts, or practice, or any other relief the court deems proper.
This bill would include, as an unlawful practice prohibited under the act, advertising, offering for sale, or selling a financial product or service that is illegal under state or federal law, including a cash payment for the assignment to a 3rd party of the consumer’s right to receive future pension or veteran’s benefits.
(2) Existing federal law prohibits payments of benefits due or to become due under any law administered by the United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs from being assignable. Under existing federal law, in any case where a beneficiary entitled to pension compensation enters into an agreement with another person under which agreement the other person acquires for consideration the right to receive the benefit by payment of a pension compensation, the agreement is deemed to be an assignment and is prohibited.
Existing state law establishes a cause of action against any person who engages in an act of unfair competition, which includes any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising, and any prohibited advertising act or practice.
This bill would state an additional prohibition against advertising, offering, or entering into an agreement with a pension beneficiary that would involve an assignment of pension benefits.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Civil Code, with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken in a transaction intended to result in the sale or lease of goods or services, to include provisions prohibiting: (1) passing off goods or services as those of another; (2) misrepresenting the source, sponsorship, approval, or certification of goods or services; (3) using representations or designations of geographic origin in connection with goods or services; (4) representing that goods or services have sponsorship, approval, characteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or quantities which they do not have or that a person has a sponsorship, approval, status, affiliation, or connection which he or she does not have; (5) representing that goods are original or new if they have deteriorated unreasonably or are altered, reconditioned, reclaimed, used, or secondhand; (6) disparaging goods or services by false or misleading representation of fact; (7) advertising goods or services with intent not to sell them as advertised; (8) advertising furniture without clearly indicating that it is unassembled if that is the case; (9) advertising the price of unassembled furniture without clearly indicating the assembled price of that furniture if the same furniture is available assembled from the seller; (10) making false or misleading statements of fact concerning reasons for, existence of, or amounts of price reductions"
"Existing law, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), requires a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage to provide a written summary of benefits and coverage (SBC) and requires that the SBC be provided in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner, as specified.
Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance.
Existing law requires a plan or insurer to provide certain disclosures of the benefits, services, and terms of a contract or policy. Existing law requires that contracts and policies subject to PPACA satisfy certain of those disclosure requirements by providing the SBC required under PPACA. Existing law requires the departments to adopt regulations establishing standards and requirements to provide enrollees and insureds with access to language assistance, including requirements for the translation of vital documents, as specified.
This bill would, commencing October 1, 2016, provide that the SBC constitutes a vital document and would require a plan or insurer to comply with requirements applicable to those documents. The bill would, commencing July 1, 2016, require the Department of Managed Health Care and the Insurance Commissioner to develop written translations of the template uniform summary of benefits and coverage and to make available those translations in specified languages on their respective Internet Web sites. Because a willful violation of those requirements by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Requires the disclosure form to provide for at least the following information, in concise and specific terms, relative to the plan, together with additional information required by the director: (1) the principal benefits and coverage of the plan, including coverage for acute and subacute care; (2) certain exceptions, reductions, and limitations that apply to the plan; (3) the full premium cost of the plan; (4) the terms under which the plan may be renewed by the plan member, including any reservation by the plan of any right to change premiums; (5) the terms under which the plan uses arbitration to settle disputes; (6) a summary of the provisions required by this Act if the plan utilizes arbitration to settle disputes; (7) information concerning the right of an enrollee to request an independent review; and (8) a description of any limitations on the patient's choice of primary care physician, or nonphysician health care practitioner. Requires the statement to disclose the nature and extent of choice permitted and the financial liability that is, or may be, incurred by the subscriber, enrollee, or third party health care practitioner."
"The Corporation Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law. That law allows, for each taxable year beginning on or after July 1, 2008, any credit that is an eligible credit, as defined, to be assigned to any eligible assignee, as defined.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to this provision.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 5, 2009. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to permit the assignment of the state tax credit of a taxpayer to any eligible assignee of that taxpayer. Permits an eligible assignee to apply all or any portion of the assigned credits against the ""tax"" of the eligible assignee for the taxable year in which the assignment occurs or any subsequent taxable year. Requires the eligible assignee to report any information necessary to substantiate any credit assigned to the eligible assignee. Prohibits any consideration from being paid by the eligible assignee for the transfer of an eligible credit."
"Existing law, the California Child Day Care Facilities Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of child day care facilities, as defined,
and crisis nurseries
by the State Department of Social Services. Existing law requires that the maximum licensed capacity for those facilities be based on 35 square feet of indoor activity space per child.
This bill would exempt those facilities from the 35 square footage requirement if the facility is located in an office building.","Amends California health and safety law to revise requirements for crisis nurseries, including requiring them to: (1) be organized and operated on a nonprofit basis; (2) be licensed by the Department of Health and Human Services to operate a crisis residential overnight program; and (3) provide crisis day services.<n><n>Requires a facility licensed on or before January 1, 2004, as a group home for children under six years of age with a licensed capacity greater than 14 children, but less than 21 children, that provides crisis nursery services to retain its capacity if issued a crisis nursery license until there is a change in the licensee's program, location, or client population.<n><n>Requires each crisis nursery to collect and maintain information, in a format specified by the department, indicating the total number of children placed in the program, the length of stay for each child, the reasons given for the use of the crisis nursery, and the age of each child.

"Existing law authorizes the court, in addition to any other penalty in an infraction, misdemeanor, or felony case, to impose a civil assessment of up to $300 against any defendant who fails, after notice and without good cause, to appear in court for any proceeding authorized by law, or who fails to pay all or any portion of a fine ordered by the court or to pay an installment of bail, as specified. Existing law provides that the assessment shall not become effective until at least 10 calendar days after the court mails a warning notice to the defendant, and requires the court, if the defendant appears within the time specified in the notice and shows good cause for the failure to appear or for the failure to pay a fine or installment of bail, to vacate the assessment.
This bill would instead provide that the assessment would not become effective until at least 20 calendar days after the court mails a warning notice to the defendant. The bill would provide that payment of bail, fines, penalties, fees, or a civil assessment is not required in order for the court to vacate the assessment at the time the person makes an appearance, as specified. The bill would also provide that payment of a civil assessment is not required to schedule a court hearing on a pending underlying charge.
Existing law requires a county to establish an amnesty program for fines and bail initially due on or before January 1, 2013, for Vehicle Code infractions to be conducted in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Judicial Council. Existing law requires the program to accept payments from October 1, 2015, to March 31, 2017, inclusive. Eligibility criteria for the program include, among other things, that the person is not currently making payments to a comprehensive collection program for fines or bail already due, as specified.
This bill would revise that criterion to make a person eligible for the program if he or she has not made any payments after September 30, 2015, to a comprehensive collection program for fines or bail already due. The bill would authorize the Judicial Council to consider, adopt, or develop recommendations for an appropriate mechanism to allow reinstatement of the driving privileges of a person who otherwise meets the criteria for amnesty but who has violations in more than one county.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on June 22, 2016. (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Vehicle Code to revise requirements for the collection of court-ordered fines and surcharges. The bill authorizes the court to impose a civil assessment of up to $3,000 against a defendant who fails to appear in court for a proceeding authorized by law or who fails to pay all or any portion of a fine ordered by the court or to pay an installment of bail as agreed to under the Vehicle Code. The assessment shall be deposited into the Trial Court Trust Fund and shall be subject to the due process requirements governing defense and collection of civil money judgments generally. The court and county shall maintain the collection program that was in effect on July 1, 2005, unless otherwise agreed to by the court and county. If a court and a county do not agree on a plan for the collection of civil assessments, or any other collections under the Government Code, the court or the county may request arbitration by a third party mutually agreed upon by the Administrative Director of the Courts and the California State Association of Counties.

"The Moore-Brown-Roberti Family Rights Act makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to refuse to grant a request by an eligible employee to take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid protected leave during any 12-month period (1) to bond with a child who was born to, adopted by, or placed for foster care with, the employee, (2) to care for the employee’s parent, spouse, or child who has a serious health condition, as defined, or (3) because the employee is suffering from a serious health condition rendering him or her unable to perform the functions of the job. The act provides that if the same employer employs both parents entitled to leave under the act, the employer is not required to grant leave in connection with the birth, adoption, or foster care of a child that would allow the parents family care and medical leave totaling more than the amount specified in the act.
The act defines “child” to mean a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis who is either under 18 years of age or an adult dependent child. The act defines “family care and medical leave” to mean, among other things, leave for reason of the serious health condition of a child, and leave to care for a parent or a spouse who has a serious health condition. The act defines “parent” to mean a biological, foster, or adoptive parent, a stepparent, a legal guardian, or other person who stood in loco parentis to the employee when the employee was a child.
This bill would make various changes to the definitions described above, thereby expanding the persons and purposes for which leave is required to be provided under the act. The bill would redefine the term “child” to include a biological, adopted, or foster son or daughter, a stepchild, a legal ward, a son or daughter of a domestic partner, or a person to whom the employee stands in loco parentis, and would remove the restriction on age or dependent status. The bill would expand the definition of leave with regard to caring for persons with a serious health condition to also include leave to care for a grandparent, grandchild, sibling, or domestic partner who has a serious health condition. The bill would include a parent-in-law in the definition of “parent.”","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003.

"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including comprehensive perinatal services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law, to the extent that federal financial participation is available, requires that midwifery services provided by a licensed midwife be covered under the Medi-Cal program.
Existing law, the Licensed Midwifery Practice Act of 1993, provides for the licensure of midwives by the Medical Board of California. Existing law authorizes a licensed midwife to assist a woman only in normal pregnancy and childbirth, which is defined as meeting specified conditions, including, among others, a pregnancy in which there is an absence of any preexisting maternal disease or condition likely to affect the pregnancy and of significant disease arising from the pregnancy. Existing law requires the board to adopt regulations further specifying those conditions.
Existing law establishes the Comprehensive Perinatal Services Program, administered by the State Department of Public Health, to maintain, to the extent resources are available, a permanent statewide community-based comprehensive perinatal system to provide care and services to low-income pregnant women and their infants who are considered underserved in terms of comprehensive perinatal care. Existing law generally authorizes a health care provider to employ or contract specified practitioners, including physicians and certified nurse midwives, for the purpose of providing comprehensive perinatal services.
This bill would additionally authorize a health care provider to employ or contract licensed midwives for the purpose of providing comprehensive perinatal services. The bill would provide that, on the effective date of the regulations adopted by the board pursuant to the provisions described above, a licensed midwife shall be eligible to serve as a “comprehensive perinatal provider,” as defined. The bill would declare that its provisions shall not be construed to revise or expand the scope of practice, as defined, of licensed midwives. The bill would require the State Department of Health Care Services to commence, no later than March 1, 2016, the revision of existing regulations as it determines are necessary for the implementation of this bill.","This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to require that the period from the establishment of pregnancy to one month following delivery be covered by comprehensive perinatal services, which shall include, but not be limited to, the provision of the combination of services developed through the former Department of Health Services Obstetrical Access Pilot Program provided or coordinated by a comprehensive perinatal provider. The comprehensive perinatal provider shall schedule visits with appropriate providers and shall track the patient to verify whether services have been received. The California Medical Assistance Program and the Maternal and Child Health Branch of the State Department of Public Health shall establish standards for health care providers and for services rendered. The Department of Health Care Services shall: (1) assist local health departments to establish a community perinatal program whose responsibilities may include certifying and monitoring providers of comprehensive perinatal services; and (2) develop systems for the monitoring and oversight of the community perinatal program."
"The Licensed Midwifery Practice Act of 1993 provides for the licensing and regulation of midwives by the Medical Board of California. The license to practice midwifery authorizes the holder to attend cases of normal childbirth and to provide prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care, including family planning care, for the mother, and immediate care for the newborn. The Licensed Midwifery Practice Act of 1993 requires a midwife to refer to a physician and surgeon under prescribed circumstances. A violation of the Licensed Midwifery Practice Act of 1993 is a crime.
The Nursing Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of the practice of nursing by the Board of Registered Nursing and authorizes the board to issue a certificate to practice nurse-midwifery to a person who meets educational standards established by the board or the equivalent of those educational standards. The Nursing Practice Act authorizes a certified nurse-midwife, under the supervision of a licensed physician and surgeon, to attend cases of normal childbirth and to provide prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care, including family-planning care, for the mother, and immediate care for the newborn, and provides that the practice of nurse-midwifery constitutes the furthering or undertaking by a certified person, under the supervision of a licensed physician and surgeon who has current practice or training in obstetrics, to assist a woman in childbirth so long as progress meets criteria accepted as normal.
This bill would authorize a midwife assistant to perform certain assistive activities under the supervision of a licensed midwife or certified nurse-midwife, including the administration of medicine, the withdrawing of blood, and midwife technical support services. The bill would define terms for these purposes. The bill would prohibit a midwife assistant from being employed for inpatient care in a licensed general acute care hospital. By adding new requirements and prohibitions to the Licensed Midwifery Practice Act of 1993, the violation of which would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(Sec. 2) Allows a midwife assistant (defined as a person who performs basic administrative, clerical, and midwife technical supportive services and who has had at least the minimum amount of hours of appropriate training pursuant to standards established by the board for a medical assistant under the Business and Professions Code) to perform all the following tasks and services in a licensed clinic, upon specific authorization and supervision of a licensed midwife or certified nurse-midwife: (1) orally administer injections; (2) perform skin tests; (3) assist in the immediate newborn care when the licensed midwife or certified nurse-midwife administers the correct medication and dosage; (4) assist in the administration of oxygen; and (5) collect by noninvasive techniques and specimens for testing. Requires the employer of a midwife assistant to retain a copy of any related certificates as a record if such assistant has met the educational and training requirements for medical assistants as established under this Act."
"Under existing law, every person who deters or prevents an executive officer from performing any of his or her duties, or knowingly resists the officer, is punishable by a fine or imprisonment, or both, as specified.
This bill would provide that the fact that a person takes a photograph or makes an audio or video recording of an executive officer, while the officer is in a public place or the person taking the photograph or making the recording is in a place he or she has the right to be, is not, in and of itself, a violation of the above-mentioned provision.

The bill would require the trustees to submit, by July 1, 2021, a report to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature that includes specified information about students who participate in the program and a summary description of significant differences in implementation of the program by campuses. The bill would require the trustees to submit recommendations, by March 15, 2017, to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature regarding potential financial incentives that could benefit students who participate in the program. The bill’s provisions would be repealed as of January 1, 2026.","Establishes the California Promise program to support California State University students in earning a baccalaureate degree within four academic years of their first year of enrollment, or for transfer from a California community college, within two years of such enrollment.

"(1) The Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act generally requires the administrator for oil spill response, acting at the direction of the Governor, to implement activities relating to oil spill response, including emergency drills and preparedness, and oil spill containment and cleanup. The act authorizes the administrator to use volunteer workers in response, containment, restoration, wildlife rehabilitation, and cleanup efforts for oil spills in waters of the state. Existing law requires the administrator to evaluate the feasibility of using commercial fishermen and other mariners for oil spill containment and cleanup.
This bill would require the administrator, in cooperation with the United States Coast Guard, to establish a schedule of drills and exercises that are required under the federal Salvage and Marine Firefighting regulations. The bill would require the administrator, on or before January 1, 2017, to submit to the Legislature a report assessing the best achievable technology of equipment for oil spill prevention, preparedness, and response and to update regulations governing the adequacy of oil spill contingency plans before July 1, 2018. The bill would require the administrator to direct the Harbor Safety Committees for various regions to assess, among other things, the presence and capability of tugs within their respective regions of responsibility to provide emergency towing of tank and nontank vessels to arrest their drift or guide emergency transit.
(2) The act requires the administrator to study the use and effects of methods used to respond to oil spills and to periodically update the study to ensure the best achievable protection from the use of those methods.
This bill would require the administrator, in conducting the study and updates, to consult current peer-reviewed published scientific literature. The bill would require the administrator, by May 1, 2016, to request that the federal California Dispersant Plan be updated, as provided, and to provide support and assistance in that regard.
(3) The act requires the administrator to license oil spill cleanup agents for use in response to oil spills.
This bill would require the administrator, if dispersants are used in response to an oil spill, to submit to the Legislature a written notification of, and a written justification for, the use of dispersants and a report on the effectiveness of the dispersants used, as provided.
(4) Existing law establishes the Oil Spill Technical Advisory Committee and requires the committee to provide recommendations to, among other entities, the administrator on the implementation of the act.
This bill would require the committee to convene a taskforce to evaluate the feasibility of using vessels of opportunity for oil spill response. The bill would require the taskforce to provide recommendations to the administrator and the Legislature on whether vessels of opportunity should be included in oil spill response planning.
(5) The act makes a person who causes or permits a spill or inland spill strictly liable for specified penalties for the spill on a per-gallon-released basis. The act provides that the amount of penalty is reduced by the amount of released oil that is recovered and properly disposed of.
This bill would eliminate that reduction in the penalty by the amount of oil recovered and properly disposed of.","This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in cooperation with the United States Coast Guard, to establish a schedule of drills and exercises required to respond to a worst case oil spill.

"The Mobilehome Residency Law governs tenancies in mobilehome parks. That law, among other things, sets forth certain rights and requirements for the management and selling homeowners in connection with the listing, sale, or exchange of a mobilehome, and, if not prohibited by management, the rental of a mobilehome, including, but not limited to, authorizing the display of signs advertising the sale, exchange, or rental, and authorizing the display of an “open house” sign unless prohibited by park rules; requiring the signs to contain specified information and be of an H-frame or A-frame design; and requiring the management, upon request of a prospective homeowner, to provide the information the management will use to determine if the person will be acceptable as a homeowner in the park. Under that law, the management or owner may be held liable for damages proximately resulting from the withholding of approval of a prospective homeowner for any reason not stated in that law.
On and after July 1, 2016, this bill would no longer condition the display of an open house sign on the lack of prohibition in park rules, but would allow a park to establish reasonable rules or regulations governing the conduct of open houses, as specified; would additionally authorize a seller to display one sign of an L-frame or a generally accepted yard-arm type design; would authorize management to require the use of a step-in L-frame sign; and would define a “listing.” The bill would require the management, upon written request, to provide in writing the information and standards the management will use to review a prospective homeowner to the prospective homeowner or seller and make technical changes. The bill would additionally condition the liability for damages resulting from withholding approval of a prospective homeowner for reasons based upon fraud, deceit, or concealment of material facts by the prospective purchaser.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 14, 2016.

Existing law requires a court to award attorney’s fees to a party that prevails in an action to compel or prohibit the division from disclosing turnaround information.
This bill would delete the requirement that a person requesting the release of the above-described information, or a petroleum refinery employer seeking to prevent disclosure, name the other as a real party in interest in an applicable action. The bill would delete the requirement that a person requesting release of this information provide notice of an action to compel disclosure to the petroleum refinery employer and would instead require the division to provide that notification. The bill would instead authorize the person to intervene in a petroleum refinery employer’s declaratory relief action and require the court to permit that person to intervene.

The act requires the office to identify funding for the system through single or multiple sources of revenue, and requires those sources to exclude the General Fund and to be limited to federal funds, funds from revenue bonds, local funds, and funds from private sources. Under the act, the requirement that the office develop the system is not operative until funding is identified, and is repealed if funding is not identified by July 1, 2016. The act establishes the California Earthquake Safety Fund in the State Treasury to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for seismic safety and earthquake-related programs, including the statewide earthquake early warning system.
This bill would discontinue the requirement that the funding sources for the system exclude the General Fund and be limited to federal funds, funds from revenue bonds, local funds, and funds from private sources. The bill would delete the provisions providing for the repeal and the contingent operation of the requirement that the office develop the system.
This bill would establish, within the office, the California Earthquake Early Warning Program and the California Earthquake Early Warning Advisory Board to support the development of the statewide earthquake early warning system, as specified. The bill would require the board to include 7 voting members, as specified, and the Chancellor of the California State University, or his or her designee, who would serve as a nonvoting member. The bill would authorize the President of the University of California, or his or her designee, to serve as an additional nonvoting member of the board. The bill would require all members to serve without compensation, but would require reimbursement for actual and reasonable travel and meal expenses to attend board meetings. The bill would require the board to comply with existing state open meeting and public record disclosure laws and would prohibit the disclosure of any information in a public record that is a trade secret, as defined, of a private entity cooperating with the board or participating in the statewide earthquake early warning system or the program. The bill would make legislative findings in support of its provisions.
(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","This bill requires the Office of Emergency Services, in collaboration with the California Institute of Technology, the California Geological Survey, the University of California, the United States Geological Survey, the Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission, and other stakeholders, to develop a comprehensive statewide earthquake early warning system in California through a public-private partnership.

The bill would prohibit a jurisdiction from purchasing, leasing, or contracting for, and a vendor, company, or person from selling, leasing, or contracting with a jurisdiction for, a ballot on demand system unless the ballot on demand system has been certified by the secretary.",This bill amends the California Elections Code to allow an eligible elector who is otherwise qualified to register to vote to complete a conditional voter registration and cast a provisional ballot during the 14 days immediately preceding an election or on election day. A conditional voter registration shall be deemed effective if the county elections official is able to determine before or during the canvass period for the election that the registrant is eligible to register to vote and that the information provided by the registrant matches information contained in a database maintained by the Department of Motor Vehicles or the Federal Social Security Administration. The county elections official shall offer conditional voter registration and provisional voting pursuant to specified procedures.
"(1) The federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act sets forth specified requirements relating to the education of homeless children and youth, as defined. Under existing state law, a local educational agency liaison for homeless children and youth is required to ensure that public notice of the educational rights of homeless children and youths is disseminated in schools within the liaison’s local educational agency, as specified.
This bill would require a local educational agency serving a homeless child, once a child becomes a homeless child, to allow the homeless child to continue his or her education in the school of origin through the duration of the homelessness, and would set forth related requirements governing the enrollment of homeless children. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law requires a pupil placed in a licensed children’s institution or foster family home to attend programs operated by the local educational agency, unless one of certain circumstances applies. Existing law requires each local educational agency to designate a staff person as the educational liaison for foster children, as defined. Existing law requires the educational liaison for foster children to ensure and facilitate the proper educational placement, enrollment in school, and checkout from school of foster children, and to assist foster children when transferring from one school to another school or from one school district to another school district in ensuring the proper transfer of credits, records, and grades. Existing law defines a local educational agency for purposes of these provisions, the provisions above relating to homeless children and youth, and other related provisions to include a school district, a county office of education, a charter school participating as a member of a special education local plan area, or a special education local plan area.
This bill would revise the definition of a local educational agency for purposes of those provisions to include all charter schools. To the extent this would impose additional duties on charter schools, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Education Code to require local educational agencies serving homeless children to allow them, at the point of any change or any subsequent change in residence once they become children, to continue their or their children's education in their school of origin through the duration of homelessness.

Existing law requires the division to transmit to the Registrar of Contractors copies of any reports made in any investigation, as specified, and authorizes the division, upon its own motion or upon request, to transmit copies of any other reports made in any investigation conducted involving a licensed contractor.
This bill would instead require the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, after consultation with the board, to transmit to the board copies of any citations or other actions taken by the division against a contractor, as defined. The bill would authorize the board to enter into an interagency agreement with any other state or local agency the board deems to be in possession of information relevant to its priority to protect the public.

This bill would specify that participation in the study by licensees and consumers is voluntary. The bill would require records or documents obtained by the board during the course of implementing this study that are exempt from public disclosure to remain exempt from disclosure.
(2) Under existing law, there exists the California Building Standards Commission. Existing law requires the California Building Standards Commission to, among other things, review the standards of adopting state agencies and approve, return for amendment with recommended changes, or reject building standards submitted to the commission for its approval, as provided.

The bill would make a licensee in violation of the prohibition subject to a fine of up to 40% of the value of the total purse.
Under existing regulation, contracts between boxers and managers and between boxers or managers and licensed clubs are required to be executed on printed forms approved by the commission. Existing regulation authorizes the commission to recognize or enforce a contract not on its printed form if entered into in another jurisdiction. Existing regulation prohibits no other contract or agreement from being recognized or enforced by the commission. Under existing regulation, all disputes between the parties to the contract, including the validity of the contract, are required to be arbitrated pursuant to the provisions of the contract. Under existing regulation, a person who seeks arbitration of a contract dispute is required to send a written request for arbitration to the commission and to the office of the Attorney General, as specified.
This bill would codify these regulatory provisions in statute and would authorize the commission to recover the costs for the arbitration from the parties subject to the arbitration.
This bill would renumber various enforcement provisions and would make other nonsubstantive changes.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to: (1) expand the duties of the California Athletic Commission; (2) require the commission to appoint an executive officer; and (3) establish an Advisory Committee on Medical and Safety Standards. The commission may call meetings of the physicians and surgeons it deems appropriate for the purpose of studying and recommending medical and safety standards for the conduct of boxing, wrestling, and martial arts contests."
"The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, commonly known as cap and trade revenues, to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for specified purposes, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions associated with water use and supply.
This bill would include reduction of greenhouse gas emissions associated with water treatment among the investments that are eligible for funding from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The bill would also make legislative findings and declarations, and a statement of legislative intent, with regard to the nexus between water and energy and water and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
This bill would require the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, in cooperation with the State Water Resources Control Board, the State Air Resources Board, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Department of Water

in cooperation with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, the State Air Resources Board, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Department of Water
Resources
Resources,
to establish a grant and loan program for water projects that result in the net reduction of water-related greenhouse gas emissions.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Act of 1974 to revise requirements for the allocation of funds from the California Energy Commission's greenhouse gas reduction fund. The bill states that it is the intent of the Legislature that moneys shall be appropriated from the fund only in a manner consistent with specified requirements of the Public Resources Code, including to: (1) maximize economic, environmental, and public health benefits to the state; (2) foster job creation by promoting in-state greenhouse gas emissions reduction projects carried out by California workers and businesses; (3) complement efforts to improve regional air quality; (4) reduce statewide natural resource conservation impacts and effects; (5) provide opportunities for businesses, public agencies, nonprofits, and other community institutions to participate in and benefit from statewide public efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and (6) reduce greenhouse gas emissions through increased in-state clean renewable energy generation through increased municipal solid waste diversion and reuse through waste reduction and recycling."
"Existing law, the Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act, establishes various procedures for the reporting, investigation, and prosecution of elder and dependent adult abuse, and provides that the purpose of the act is to, among other things, collect information on the number of abuse victims, circumstances surrounding the abuse, and other data. The act defines the term “abuse of an elder or a dependent adult” for its purposes.
Existing law also makes it a crime for a person who knows or reasonably should know that a person is an elder or dependent adult to willfully cause or permit the person or health of the elder or dependent adult to be injured, or willfully cause or permit the elder or dependent adult to be placed in a situation in which his or her person or health is endangered. Existing law specifies penalties for a person who violates any law proscribing theft, embezzlement, forgery, or fraud, or specified identity theft laws, when the victim is an elder or a dependent adult.
This bill would require a person who is convicted for a crime involving the abuse of an elder adult, as defined in the Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act, to register for the remainder of his or her life with all police departments and the sheriff in the county in which the person was convicted and in the county in which he or she resides. The bill would require the police department or county sheriff to forward the registration information to the Department of Justice. The bill would require the Department of Justice to maintain a publicly accessible Internet Web site containing certain information concerning persons who are required to register pursuant to these provisions. The bill would make it a crime to use information obtained from the Internet Web site to commit a crime, and would subject a person who uses information obtained from the Internet Web site for any other reason than to protect an at-risk person to civil liability, as specified. The bill would relieve a person from the duty to register pursuant to these provisions if he or she receives a certificate of rehabilitation and he or she is not in custody, on parole, or on probation. The bill would make it a misdemeanor for a person who is required to register pursuant to these provisions to willfully violate any requirements related to registration. By creating new crimes and imposing new duties on local police departments and county sheriffs related to registering individuals convicted of a crime involving the abuse of an elder adult, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
The Home Care Services Consumer Protection Act, operative January 1, 2016, provides for the registration of home care aides. Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to consider specified information when determining whether to approve a home care aide’s registration application, including, among other things, evidence satisfactory to the department of the home care aide applicant’s ability to comply with the act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the department under the act.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.","Amends the California Penal Code to require a person convicted of a crime involving abuse of an adult to register with all police departments and the sheriff in the county in which the person was convicted and in the county in which he or she resides. Requires: (1) the court to notify such a person of his or her duty to register at the time of his or her conviction; (2) a person who does not serve a term of imprisonment as a result of such conviction to register within five business days of such conviction; and (3) a person required to register to notify all police departments and the sheriff in the county in which the person was convicted, in the county in which he or she resides, and, if applicable, in which he or she previously resided and was required to register within five business days of moving or changing his or her name.

"Existing law requires the State Public Health Officer to establish rules and regulations establishing minimum standards for organized camps, and regulations governing the operation of organized camps that he or she determines are necessary to protect the health and safety of the campers. Existing law establishes minimum standards for the operation, regulation, and enforcement of organized camps, as defined.
This bill would recast those provisions and instead define an “organized camp” to include an “organized resident camp” and an “organized day camp,” as specified, that provides activities that promote environmental awareness and education.
This bill would exclude from “organized camps” physical education-based organizations, gymnastics studios, sports training organizations, and theatre programs, among others.

The bill would also require those camps to comply with applicable safety and supervision requirements relating to camp directors and counselors, install a carbon monoxide detector in specified buildings, and store firearms in a locked storage cabinet when not in use, as specified. The bill would also require those camps to obtain a permit to operate, or, for an organized day camp that does not have a fixed location, to register with the local public health officer and receive authorization to operate, from the local public health officer, and to post the permit or authorization, as specified.
The bill would authorize the local public health officer to inspect the camp and charge fees for camp oversight activities. The bill would also authorize a person alleging health and sanitation violations to file a complaint with the local public health officer, and to require the local public health officer to investigate. The bill would also require the State Department of Public Health, in adopting or amending the rules and regulations pertaining to organized camps, to make reasonable efforts to obtain the input and advice of prescribed organizations.
Because this bill would impose additional duties upon local public health officers in cities and counties, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

"The Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act requires a mandated reporter, as defined, to make a report to a specified agency whenever the mandated reporter, in his or her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her employment, has knowledge of or observes a child whom the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect. Existing law further requires the mandated reporter to make an initial report by telephone to the agency immediately or as soon as is practicably possible, and to prepare and send, fax, or electronically transmit a written followup report within 36 hours of receiving the information concerning the incident.
This bill, until January 1, 2021, would authorize certain county welfare agencies to develop a pilot program for Internet-based reporting of child abuse and neglect, as specified. The bill would impose specified standards on a county that participates in the pilot program. The bill would also require the State Department of Social Services to consult with the County Welfare Directors Association of California and the county welfare agencies of the individual counties to determine which counties may be involved in the pilot program. The bill would require the department to oversee and administer the pilot program, and require a county that chooses to participate in the pilot program to hire an evaluator to monitor implementation of the program. The bill would require a county that participates in the pilot program to develop outcome measures that determine the effectiveness of the pilot program of the county, as specified, and report to specified committees of the Legislature on or before January 1, 2020, on the effectiveness of the pilot program. The bill would authorize the department to conclude the pilot program prior to January 1, 2021, if the evaluation and monitoring indicate that implementation of the program compromises the safety of children.","This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to authorize a county welfare agency to develop a pilot program for Internet-based reporting of child abuse and neglect. The pilot program may receive reports by mandated reporters of suspected child abuse or neglect and shall meet all of the following conditions: the suspected child abuse or neglect does not indicate that the child is subject to an immediate risk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation or that the child is in imminent danger of severe harm or death; the agency provides an Internet form that includes standardized safety assessment qualifying questions in order to obtain necessary information required to assess the need for child welfare services and a response; the agency provides an Internet-based reporting system that has appropriate security protocols to preserve the confidentiality of reports and any documents or photographs submitted through the system; and the mandated reporter is required to complete all required fields, including identity and contact information, in order to submit the report. The agency shall provide guidance through written directives to counties participating in the pilot program to incorporate qualifying questions in the online report that would indicate the need to redirect the mandated reporter to perform a telephone report."
"The California Constitution authorizes the Legislature to classify personal property for differential taxation or for exemption by means of a statute approved by a
2/3
vote of the membership of each house.
This bill would, pursuant to this constitutional authorization, on and after July 1, 2016,
to before July 1, 2026,
impose a tax on every qualified renter for the privilege of renting qualified heavy equipment in this state at the rate of 0.75% of the rental price from the renting of qualified heavy equipment. This bill would require a qualified renter to pay and remit the tax, as provided. This bill would provide that this tax shall be in lieu of any personal property tax on qualified heavy equipment. This bill would require the tax to be administered by the State Board of Equalization and to be collected pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Fee Collection Procedures Law. This bill would require all revenues, interest, penalties, and other amounts, less refunds and the board’s costs of administration, derived from the imposition of the tax to be deposited in the General Fund.
Existing property tax law requires the county auditor, in each fiscal year, to allocate property tax revenue to local jurisdictions in accordance with specified formulas and procedures, and generally requires that each jurisdiction be allocated an amount equal to the total of the amount of revenue allocated to that jurisdiction in the prior fiscal year, subject to certain modifications, and that jurisdiction’s portion of the annual tax increment, as defined. Existing property tax law also reduces the amounts of ad valorem property tax revenue that would otherwise be annually allocated to the county, cities, and special districts pursuant to these general allocation requirements by requiring, for purposes of determining property tax revenue allocations in each county for the 1992–93 and 1993–94 fiscal years, that the amounts of property tax revenue deemed allocated in the prior fiscal year to the county, cities, and special districts be reduced in accordance with certain formulas. It requires that the revenues not allocated to the county, cities, and special districts as a result of these reductions be transferred to the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund in that county for allocation to school districts, community college districts, and the county office of education.
This bill would, for the 2016–17 fiscal year
and for each fiscal year thereafter,
to the 2025–26 fiscal year, inclusive,
require the county auditor to increase the total amount of ad valorem property tax revenue that is otherwise required to be allocated among the county and each city and special district in the county by the qualified heavy equipment reimbursement amount, as defined, and to commensurately decrease the amount of ad valorem property tax revenue that is otherwise required to be allocated to the county Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and, if necessary, the amount of those

revenues
otherwise required to be allocated to school districts, as specified, by the qualified heavy equipment reimbursement amount.
By expanding the application of the Fee Collection Procedures Law, the violation of which is a crime, and by imposing new duties upon local officials in the allocation of ad valorem property tax revenues, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.
This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.","This bill requires California, for each of FY2026 and each ensuing fiscal year, to increase the rate of ad valorem property tax on qualified heavy equipment and provide for the allocation of such tax revenues among local agencies and school districts. The bill defines &quot;qualified heavy equipment&quot; as any heavy equipment that is mobile or other industrial equipment that is intended to be used at a worksite or by a renter that is engaged in the rental of qualified heavy equipment, including mobile generation equipment and other ancillary rental equipment driven by the person engaged in the business."
"Existing law classifies certain controlled substances into designated schedules. Existing law requires the Department of Justice to maintain the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) for the electronic monitoring of the prescribing and dispensing of Schedule II, Schedule III, and Schedule IV controlled substances by all practitioners authorized to prescribe, administer, furnish, or dispense these controlled substances. Existing law requires dispensing pharmacies and clinics to report specified information for each prescription of a Schedule II, Schedule III, or Schedule IV controlled substance to the department.
This bill would require a health care practitioner authorized to prescribe, order, administer, or furnish a controlled substance to consult the CURES database to review a patient’s controlled substance history no earlier than 24 hours, or the previous business day, before prescribing a Schedule II, Schedule III, or Schedule IV controlled substance to the patient for the first time and at least once every 4 months thereafter if the substance remains part of the treatment of the patient. The bill would exempt a veterinarian and a pharmacist from this requirement. The bill would also exempt a health care practitioner from this requirement under specified circumstances, including, among others, if prescribing, ordering, administering, or furnishing a controlled substance to a patient receiving hospice care, to a patient admitted to a specified facility for use while on facility premises, or to a patient as part of a treatment for a surgical procedure in a specified facility if the quantity of the controlled substance does not exceed a nonrefillable 5-day supply of the controlled substance that is to be used in accordance with the directions for use. The bill would require, if a health care practitioner authorized to prescribe, order, administer, or furnish a controlled substance is not required to consult the CURES database the first time he or she prescribes, orders, administers, or furnishes a controlled substance to a patient pursuant to one of those exemptions, the health care practitioner to consult the CURES database before subsequently prescribing a Schedule II, Schedule III, or Schedule IV controlled substance to the patient and at least once every 4 months thereafter if the substance remains part of the treatment of the patient.
This bill would provide that a health care practitioner who fails to consult the CURES database is required to be referred to the appropriate state professional licensing board solely for administrative sanctions, as deemed appropriate by that board. The bill would make the above-mentioned provisions operative 6 months after the Department of Justice certifies that the CURES database is ready for statewide use and that the department has adequate staff, user support, and education, as specified.
This bill would also exempt a health care practitioner, pharmacist, and any person acting on behalf of a health care practitioner or pharmacist, when acting with reasonable care and in good faith, from civil or administrative liability arising from any false, incomplete, inaccurate, or misattributed information submitted to, reported by, or relied upon in the CURES database or for any resulting failure of the CURES database to accurately or timely report that information.
Existing law requires the operation of the CURES database to comply with all applicable federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations. Existing law authorizes the disclosure of data obtained from the CURES database to agencies and entities only for specified purposes and requires the Department of Justice to establish policies, procedures, and regulations regarding the use, access, disclosure, and security of the information within the CURES database.
This bill would authorize a health care practitioner to provide a patient with a copy of the patient’s CURES patient activity report if no additional CURES data is provided. The bill would also prohibit a regulatory board whose licensees do not prescribe, order, administer, furnish, or dispense controlled substances from obtaining data from the CURES database.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on February 15, 2010. The summary of that version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) Amends the Health and Safety Code to direct the Department of Justice, contingent upon the availability of adequate funds in the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) Fund, to maintain CURES for the electronic monitoring of, and Internet access to information regarding, the prescribing and dispensing of Schedule II, Schedule III, and Schedule IV controlled substances by all practitioners authorized to prescribe, order, administer, furnish, or dispense these controlled substances. Authorizes the Department of Justice to seek and use grant funds to pay the costs incurred by CURES. Requires the Department to annually report to the Legislature and make available to the public the amount and source of funds it receives for support of CURES.) Provides that data obtained from CURES shall only be provided to appropriate state, local, and federal public agencies for disciplinary, civil, or criminal purposes and to other agencies or entities for the purpose of educating practitioners and others in lieu of disciplinary, civil, or criminal actions.

"(1) Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health and sets forth its powers and duties, including, but not limited to, the licensing and regulation of health facilities, including, but not limited to, general acute care hospitals. A violation of these provisions is a crime.
Existing law authorizes the department to issue a special permit authorizing a health facility to offer one or more special services when specified requirements are met. Existing law requires general acute care hospitals to apply for supplemental services approval and requires the department to, upon issuance and renewal of a license for certain health facilities, separately identify on the license each supplemental service. Existing law requires a hospital to report specified summary financial and utilization data to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) within 45 days of the end of every calendar quarter.
This bill would require a general acute care hospital that provides observation services, as defined, to apply for approval from the department to provide these services as supplemental services. The bill would require the department to adopt standards and regulations for a hospital providing observation services as an approved supplemental service under the general acute care hospital’s license. The bill would require hospitals to include certain data relating to observation service visits and total observation service gross revenues in the reports filed with OSHPD.
(2) Because a violation of these provisions by a health facility would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Health and Safety Code to define ""observation services"" as outpatient services provided by a general acute care hospital to patients who have unstable or uncertain conditions potentially serious enough to warrant close observation, but not so serious as to warrant inpatient admission the hospital. Allows such services to be provided for no more than 24 hours, and to be ordered only for the following: (1) a patient who has received services in the emergency department but has not been admitted as an inpatient; (2) a patient who has received outpatient surgical services and procedures; (3) a patient who has been admitted as an inpatient and is discharged to receive observation services; and (4) a patient previously seen in a physician's office or outpatient clinic. Specifies that observation services provided by the hospital in an observation unit shall comply with the same staffing standards, including, but not limited to, licensed nurse-to-patient ratios as supplemental emergency services. Requires a patient receiving observation services to receive written notice that his or her care is being provided on an outpatient basis, and that this may impact reimbursement by Medicare, Medi-Cal, or private payers of health care services, or cost-sharing arrangements through his or her health care coverage. Requires observation units to be marked with signage identifying the area as an outpatient area."
"(1) The California Community Care Facilities Act provides for the licensure and regulation of community care facilities, including foster family homes and group homes, by the State Department of Social Services. A violation of this act is a misdemeanor.
Under existing law, a child in a group home may receive mental health services, as deemed necessary by the placing agency and under the case management of that agency. Under existing law, only a juvenile court judicial officer may make orders regarding the administration of psychotropic medications to a child adjudged a dependent or ward of the court and removed from the physical custody of the parent. Existing law requires that the order be based on a request from a physician, indicating the reasons for the request and a description of the child’s diagnosis and behavior, among other requirements.
This bill would provide that psychotropic medications may be used at a group home, other than at a runaway and homeless youth shelter, only in accordance with the written directions of the physician prescribing the medication and as authorized by the juvenile court. The bill would require the group home to maintain in the child’s records specified information regarding the administration of those medications.
(2) Existing law requires the Director of Social Services, at least annually, to publish and make available to interested persons a list covering all licensed community care facilities, except as specified, and the services for which each facility has been licensed or issued a special permit.
This bill would require the department to compile specified information regarding the administration of psychotropic medications to children in group homes and to post that information on the department’s Internet Web site. The bill would require the department, in consultation with the State Department of Health Care Services and stakeholders, to establish a methodology to identify those group homes that have levels of psychotropic drug utilization warranting additional review, as specified. The bill would also require the department, for the facilities identified by the methodology that it establishes, to visit those facilities at least once a year to examine specified factors. The bill would authorize the department, following that inspection, to share relevant information and observations with county placing agencies, social workers, probation officers, the court, dependency counsel, or the Medical Board of California, or share relevant information and observations with the facility and require the facility to submit a plan to the department, within 30 days of receiving the department’s information and observations, to address any identified risks within the control of the facility related to psychotropic medication. The bill would require the department to approve the plan and verify the plan’s implementation to determine whether those identified risks have been remedied. Because the failure of the facility to comply with these provisions would be a misdemeanor, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) Existing law requires the department, on or before January 1, 2016, in consultation with specified associations and other stakeholders, to develop additional performance standards and outcome measures that require group homes to implement programs and services to minimize law enforcement contacts with minors in group homes or under supervision of group home staff.
This bill would require the department, on or before January 1, 2017, in consultation with specified associations and other stakeholders, to develop additional performance standards and outcome measures that require group homes to implement alternative programs and services, as specified. The bill would make related changes.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(Sec. 2) Requires the Department of Social Services, at least annually, to publish a list or lists covering all licensed community care facilities, other than foster family homes and certified family homes of foster family agencies providing 24-hour care for six or fewer children.

Limits the disclosure of such information under the Information Practices Act of 1977 to bona fide professional foster parent organizations and to professional organizations educating foster parents, including the Foster and Kinship Care Education Program of the California Community Colleges. Authorizes the Department to issue a citation and, after the issuance of that citation, assess a civil penalty of 50 dollars per day for each instance of a foster family agency failure to provide it with the information required by this section, only to bona fide professional foster parent organizations and to professional organizations educating foster parents, including the Foster and Kinship Care Education Program of the California Community Colleges"

The bill would require a district to consult with the Los Angeles County Flood Control District and the relevant watermaster or water replenishment district prior to initiating a stormwater or dry weather runoff program within the boundaries of an adjudicated groundwater basin or within the service area of a water replenishment district, as applicable. The bill would make related changes.

The bill applies only to the county sanitation districts. Prior to initiating a stormwater or dry weather runoff program or project within the boundaries of an adjudicated groundwater basin, a district shall consult with the relevant watermaster for a preliminary determination as to whether the project is inconsistent with the adjudication. If the watermaster deems the project inconsistent with the adjudication, the measures necessary to conform the project to the adjudication shall be recommended. A district may acquire construct, operate maintain, and furnish facilities for diversion and treatment of stormwater and dry weather runoff from the stormwater drainage system within the district."
"Under existing law, the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, the State Department of Developmental Services is authorized to contract with regional centers to provide services and supports to individuals with developmental disabilities. Existing law requires an entity that receives payments between $250,000 and $500,000 per year from one or more regional centers to obtain an independent audit or review of its financial statements and requires an entity that receives payments that are equal to or more than $500,000 per year to obtain an independent audit. Existing law exempts payments made using usual and customary rates for services provided by regional centers from these requirements.
This bill would instead require an entity to obtain an independent audit or review report of its financial statements relating to payments made by regional centers if it receives payments between $500,000 and $2,000,000 from one or more regional centers and would authorize these entities to apply for, and require the regional center to grant, a 2-year exemption from this requirement if the regional center does not find issues in the audit or review that have an impact on regional center services. The bill would also require an entity to obtain an independent audit if it receives payments that are equal to or more than $2,000,000 and would authorize these entities to apply for, and require the regional center to grant, a 2-year exemption from the audit requirement if the audit resulted in an unmodified opinion, an unmodified opinion with additional communication, or a qualified opinion with issues that are not material and pervasive. The bill would require a regional center to notify the department of any exemption it grants to an entity that receives a qualified opinion report.

Existing law provides that the State Board of Optometry is required, by regulation, to establish educational and examination requirements for licensure to ensure the competence of optometrists to practice. Existing law requires an applicant for licensure to submit an application that is provided under oath and to pay a prescribed fee. All fees are deposited in the Optometry Fund, which is continuously appropriated to the board to administer the act. Any violation of the act is a crime.
Existing law authorizes the board to permit a graduate of a foreign university who meets specified requirements to take the examinations for an optometrist license.
This bill would revise the license examination requirements for a graduate of a foreign university to, among other things, require submission of an application and payment of a prescribed fee.
This bill would also authorize the board to issue a license to a graduate of a foreign university who meets specified requirements, including requirements that the applicant have permission to take the examinations for an optometrist license, submit an application on a form approved by the board, and pay a prescribed fee for an application for licensure.
By increasing the amount of moneys deposited into a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation. Because the application would be required to be provided under oath, this bill would expand the scope of an existing crime and create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.",Amends the Business and Professions Code to require the California Board of Optometry to permit a graduate of a foreign university who meets specified requirements to take the examinations for an optometrist license to: (1) be over 18 years of age; (2) not be subject to denial of a license under State law; (3) have obtained a degree as a doctor of optometry issued by a university located outside the United States that has a minimum of four year or equivalent curriculum leading to an optometry license in the country where the program is located; (4) submit an application to obtain a letter of sponsorship on a form approved by the board; (5) pay the fee for the licensure application; and (6) have no physical or mental impairment related to drugs or alcohol and has not been found mentally incompetent by a licensed psychologist or licensed psychiatrist so that the person is unable to undertake the practice of optometry in a manner consistent with the safety of a patient or the public. <n>Requires the board to: (1) require a graduate of a foreign university to provide any supporting documents requested by the board to establish that such requirements have been met; and (2) determine from the evaluation whether the applicant has met the educational requirements that are reasonable and necessary to ensure that an optometrist has the knowledge to adequately protect the public health and safety.

"Existing law, the Personal Income Tax Law, imposes a tax on the entire taxable income of a resident taxpayer subject to that law, and provides for a specified treatment of the income of nonresidents. For purposes of computing the taxable income, the gross income of a nonresident includes only the gross income from sources within this state. Existing law requires every taxpayer subject to tax under the law to file a return with the Franchise Tax Board, stating specifically the items of the gross income from all sources and the deductions and credits allowable, as provided.
This bill would provide, for purposes of computing the taxable income of a nonresident, that the gross income of a nonresident from sources within this state does not include “de minimis income,” defined as compensation subject to specified withholding if the nonresident has no other income from sources within this state, is present in this state to perform employment duties on behalf of an employer and any other related person for not more than

"Existing law authorizes a person to petition the court for an order sealing the record of conviction and other official records in a case in which that person was under 18 years of age at the time of commission of a misdemeanor and is eligible for, or has previously received, specified relief. Existing law authorizes that person to be required to reimburse the court, the county, or any city for the actual cost of services rendered, as specified.
This bill would only make persons 26 years of age or older liable to reimburse the court, the county, or any city for the cost of services.
Existing law authorizes in a case in which a petition has been filed with a juvenile court to commence proceedings to adjudge a person a ward of the court, in a case in which a person is cited to appear before a probation officer or is taken before a probation officer pursuant to a specified provision of law, or in a case in which a minor is taken before an officer of a law enforcement agency, the person or the county probation officer to petition the court for the sealing of arrest records and records relating to the person’s case in the custody of the juvenile court and the probation officer and any other agencies, including law enforcement agencies and public officials as the petitioner alleges to have custody of the records.
This bill would prohibit an unfulfilled order of restitution that has been converted to a civil judgment from barring the sealing of a record pursuant to the above provisions. The bill would also prohibit outstanding restitution fines and court-ordered fees from being considered when assessing whether a petitioner’s rehabilitation has been attained to the satisfaction of the court and from barring the sealing of a record pursuant to the above provisions. The bill would provide that a minor is not relieved of the obligation to pay victim restitution, restitution fines, and court-ordered fines and fees because the minor’s records are sealed. The bill would provide that sealing a record does not prohibit a court from enforcing a civil judgment for an unfulfilled order of restitution, and that a victim or a local collection program may continue to enforce victim restitution orders, restitution fines, and court-ordered fines and fees after a record is sealed. By increasing the number of records local agencies would be required to seal, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law makes a father, mother, spouse, or other person liable for the support of a minor person, the minor when he or she becomes an adult, or the estates of those persons, liable for the cost to the county and court for any investigation related to the sealing and for the sealing of any juvenile court or arrest records pursuant to the above-mentioned provisions. Existing law also authorizes those persons to be required to reimburse the court, county, or a city for the actual cost of services rendered, as specified.
This bill would only require persons 26 years of age or older who petition for an order sealing his or her record, pursuant to specified provisions, to be liable for the investigative costs and to reimburse the costs of services rendered.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Penal Code and the Welfare and Institutions Code to allow an eligible person under age 18 at the time of commission of a misdemeanor to petition the court for an order sealing the record of conviction and other official records, including records of arrests resulting in the criminal proceeding and records relating to other offenses charged in the accusatory pleading, whether the defendant was acquitted or charges were dismissed. Declares that thereafter the conviction, arrest, or other proceeding shall be deemed not to have occurred and the petitioner may answer any question relating to their occurrence. Applies this Act to convictions that occurred before, as well as those that occur after, the effective date of this Act. Specifies that this Act shall not apply to a person convicted of more than one offense whether the second or additional convictions occurred in the same action in which the conviction as to which relief is sought occurred or in another action, except in specified cases."
"Existing law provides for the civil commitment of criminal offenders who have been determined to be sexually violent predators for treatment in a secure state hospital facility. Under existing law, persons to be evaluated for civil commitment are evaluated by 2 practicing psychiatrists or psychologists designated by the Director of State Hospitals. If both evaluators concur that the person is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence without appropriate treatment and custody, the director is required to forward a request for a petition for commitment to the district attorney or county counsel, who may then file the petition with the court.
Under existing law, if the attorney petitioning for commitment determines that updated evaluations are necessary in order to properly present the case for commitment, the attorney may request the department to perform updated evaluations, which include the review of available medical and psychological records, including treatment records, consultation with current treating clinicians, and interviews of the person being evaluated. Existing law requires that the department forward the updated evaluations to the petitioning attorney and to the counsel for the person who is the subject of the commitment hearing.
This bill would require the evaluator performing an updated evaluation to include a statement listing the medical and psychological records reviewed by the evaluator, and would direct the court to issue a subpoena, upon the request of either party to the civil commitment proceeding, for a certified copy of these records. The bill would authorize the attorneys to use the records in the commitment proceeding, but would prohibit disclosure of the records for any other purpose.","Requires the State Department of State Hospitals to conduct two additional evaluations if an updated or replacement evaluation results in a split opinion as to whether the person subject to this article meets the criteria for commitment, unless the person does not meet such criteria.Provides that if the person subject to this article or the petitioning attorney does not demand a jury trial, the trial shall be before the court without a jury.

The term “plastic product” is defined for purposes of these prohibitions.
This bill would authorize the labeling of commercial agricultural mulch film, as defined, sold in the state as “soil biodegradable” if it meets a specified standard for biodegradability of plastics adopted by ASTM International and that standard is also adopted by the Director of Resources Recycling and Recovery. The bill also would make nonsubstantive changes relating to the definition of ASTM International.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2009. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Public Resources Code to prohibit the sale of certain plastic products that are not biodegradable unless the product meets certain standards of the ASTM International (formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials), including the Standard Specification for ASTM Home Plastics D or the ASTM Standard Specification for Non-accredited Plastics in the Marine Environment D7081, except in specified California subdivisions. Permits the sale of certain plastic products that meet the standards of the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, however, if the Department adopts a standard that does not constitute compliance with such standards."
"Existing law makes it a crime to engage in a motor vehicle speed contest on a highway. Existing law prohibits an individual from driving a vehicle upon a highway or in an offstreet parking facility in a reckless manner. Existing law authorizes a peace officer, upon determining that a person was engaged in any of these crimes, to impound the vehicle used for the offense for no more than 30 days. Existing law provides that if a person is convicted of engaging in a motor vehicle speed contest on a highway and the vehicle used in the violation is registered to that person, the vehicle may be impounded at the registered owner’s expense for not less than one day nor more than 30 days.
This bill would require the vehicle used in the violation of the crimes above, if it is registered to the person convicted of engaging in a motor vehicle speed contest or reckless driving, to be impounded for 30 days, subject to specified exceptions. By imposing new requirements on local agencies, the bill would create a state-mandated local program. The bill would clarify that, upon finding a violation of any mechanical requirements, an officer to issue a notice to correct, and require the correction to be made within 30 days of release of the vehicle from impoundment. The bill would also require the vehicle to be released before the 30th day if the legal owner who is not the registered owner, holds a security interest in the vehicle, presents foreclosure documents or an affidavit of repossession, and meets other specified conditions.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(Sec. 2) Revises California criminal code provisions regarding reckless driving to prohibit a person from: (1) engaging in a motor vehicle speed contest against another vehicle on a highway; (2) aiding or abetting in any motor vehicle speed contest or exhibition upon any highway; or (3) engaging in any motor vehicle obstruction or place of employment on any highway. Provides that a vehicle shall be released from impoundment if certain conditions are met, including that: (1) the legal owner is a motor vehicle dealer, bank, credit union, acceptance corporation, or other licensed financial institution legally operating or another person legally operating the vehicle, not the registered owner; (2) the legal owner pays all towing and storage fees related to impoundment of the vehicle; and (3) no lien sale processing fees shall be charged to a legal owner who redeems the vehicle on or before the 15th day of impoundment.

"Existing federal law provides for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly the Food Stamp Program, under which nutrition assistance benefits, formerly referred to as food stamps, are allocated to each state by the federal government. That program, as administered in California, is known as CalFresh. Under existing state law, pursuant to CalFresh, California’s federal allocation is distributed to eligible individuals by each county. Existing law establishes eligibility and benefit level requirements for receipt of CalFresh benefits.
Existing law authorizes counties to participate in the CalFresh Employment and Training (CalFresh E&T) program, established with the purpose of assisting members of CalFresh households to obtain regular employment, and requires participating counties to screen CalFresh work registrants to determine whether they will participate in, or be exempt from, the CalFresh E&T program.
The bill would require the State Department of Social Services to request a waiver from the federal government to allow county human services agencies to serve CalFresh E&T recipients for up to 5 months, to match the length of services of transitional CalFresh benefits
with the post-employment services of the CalFresh E&T program, for a period of up to 5 months
. By imposing additional duties on local agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would require the department, in order to improve employment opportunities and increase wages of CalFresh recipients by increasing access to adult and
post-secondary
postsecondary
education and vocational training programs at California community colleges, annually issue guidance through all county letters for county human services agencies wishing to partner with a community college in the administration of its CalFresh E&T program, as specified.
Existing federal law provides for allocation of federal funds through the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant program to eligible states. Existing law provides for the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program for the allocation of federal funds received through the TANF program, under which each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families.
Under existing law, when an individual fails or refuses to comply with specified components of the CalWORKs program without good cause, the individual is subject to prescribed financial sanctions.
This bill would provide that when a CalWORKs recipient has been sanctioned due to noncompliance with his or her welfare-to-work plan, the recipient shall not be assigned a CalFresh penalty until the county has determined that the individual does not qualify for an exemption to the CalFresh work requirement and has not registered for work, the county has notified the recipient that the recipient is not eligible for an exemption, and has instructed the recipient about how to comply with the requirements or verify an exemption to the CalFresh work requirements. The bill would also require that if the CalFresh recipient complies with the requirement during the notice of adverse action period and has registered for work with the Employment Development Department, the proposed penalty would be canceled and would not count as an occurrence for the purposes of determining the length of future CalFresh disqualification periods. By imposing additional duties on local agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require the CalFresh E&T program to be included in the state’s Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act state plan in order to improve coordination between established workforce training programs.
The bill would state findings and declarations by the Legislature relative to unemployment rates and CalFresh recipients.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

"Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, commonly known as cap and trade revenues, to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for specified purposes. Existing law provides various programs to fund the acquisition of schoolbuses.
This bill would create the Schoolbus Replacement for Small and Disadvantaged Communities Grant Program, and would appropriate $5 million annually from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to the State Department of Education for the program. The program would be administered by the department in conjunction with the State Air Resources Board, and would provide schoolbus replacement grants to school districts or county offices of education with an average daily attendance of less than 2,501 and with more than 50% of the pupil population qualifying for free or reduced-rate lunch programs, and to certain other eligible applicants. The bill would impose various requirements in that regard. The bill would also make legislative findings and declarations.
Under existing law, fees required by the Vehicle Code are delinquent when a vehicle is operated on a highway without those fees first having been paid and when those fees have not been paid within 20 days of the vehicle’s first operation, subject to specified exceptions.
This bill would increase that amount of time to 30 days.","This bill creates a program to fund the purchase of new schoolbuses for small and disadvantaged communities through grants to eligible school districts, county offices of education, and State Special Schools. Funds made available under the program shall be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"Existing law, the Respiratory Care Practice Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of the practice of respiratory therapy by the Respiratory Care Board of California. A violation of the act is a crime.
Existing law declares it is the intent of the Legislature to recognize the existence of overlapping functions between physicians and surgeons, registered nurses, physical therapists, respiratory care practitioners, and other licensed health care personnel, and to permit additional sharing of functions within organized health care systems, as specified. Existing law also states that nothing in the act shall be construed to authorize a respiratory care practitioner to practice medicine, surgery, or any other form of healing, except as authorized by the act.
This bill, for intent purposes, would define “overlapping functions” to include providing therapy, management, rehabilitation, diagnostic evaluation, and care for nonrespiratory-related diagnoses or conditions provided certain requirements are met.
Under existing law, respiratory care as a practice means a health care profession employed under the supervision of a medical director in the therapy, management, rehabilitation, diagnostic evaluation, and care of patients with deficiencies and abnormalities which affect the pulmonary system and associated aspects of cardiopulmonary and other systems functions, and includes, among other things, direct and indirect pulmonary care services that are safe, aseptic, preventive, and restorative to the patient. Existing law provides for the registration and regulation of certified polysomnographic technologists by the Medical Board of California. Under existing law governing polysomnographic technologists, the practice of polysomnography is defined to include the treatment, management, diagnostic testing, control, education, and care of patients with sleep and wake disorders. Existing law governing polysomnographic technologists exempts from those provisions, among others, respiratory care practitioners working within the scope of practice of their license.
This bill would provide that associated aspects of cardiopulmonary and other systems functions includes patients with deficiencies and abnormalities affecting the heart and cardiovascular system. The bill would further define the respiratory care practice to include, among other things, the administration of medical gases and pharmacological agents for the purpose of inducing conscious or deep sedation under specified supervision and direct orders, all forms of specified life support, and the treatment, management, diagnostic testing, control, education, and care of patients with sleep and wake disorders. By changing the definition of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Business and Professions Code to redefine "" respiratory care as a practice,"" for purposes of provisions regarding licensed health care professionals, to include, among other things: (1) direct and indirect pulmonary care services that are safe, restorative, and restorative to the patient; (2) direct and indirect respiratory care services, including administration of diagnostic and therapeutic agents related to respiratory care procedures prescribed by a physician and surgeon; (3) observation and monitoring of signs and symptoms, general behavior, general physical response to respiratory care treatment and diagnostic testing, abnormalities, behavior, or general response to respiratory care protocols, initiation of emergency procedures, and the diagnostic and therapeutic use of medical gases, exclusive of general anesthesia; (4) respiratory care protocols, including resuscitation without cutting tissues; (5) the transcription and implementation of the written and verbal orders of a physician and surgeon pertaining to the practice of ventilator inducing or sedation under physician and surgeon supervision and the administration of medical gases and pharmacological agents; (6) all forms of extra life support, including carbon dioxide removal when oxygenation is necessary; and (7) respiratory care protocols, including policies and protocols developed by a licensed health facility through collaboration with administrators, physicians and surgeons, physical therapists, respiratory care practitioners, and other licensed health care practitioners.(Sec. 3) Includes within the definition"
"Existing law generally provides that the spouse or partner who controls the disposition of or who receives or spends community income, as well as the spouse who is taxable on the income, is liable for the payment of the taxes imposed by the Personal Income Tax Law on that income, and that whenever a joint income tax return is filed by spouses or registered domestic partners the liability for the tax is joint and several. Existing law allows, under specified conditions, a court in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage to revise the income tax liabilities on a joint return of spouses or registered domestic partners, but prohibits revisions to relieve a spouse or domestic partner of tax liability on income earned by or subject to the exclusive management and control of the spouse or domestic partner. Existing law also provides that the order revising tax liability is not effective if the gross income reportable on the return exceeds $150,000 or the amount of the tax liability the spouse is relieved of exceeds $7,500, except as specified.
This bill would instead provide that an order revising tax liability may relieve a spouse or domestic partner of tax liability on income earned by or subject to the exclusive management and control of that spouse or domestic partner, except if assets or liabilities are transferred between the individuals filing the joint return for the principal purpose of avoidance of the payment of tax or as part of a fraudulent scheme by those individuals or that liability is uncollectible or if, within 3 years of when the court order is effective, specified conditions apply. This bill would also instead provide that the order revising tax liability is not effective if the gross income reportable on the return exceeds $200,000 or the amount of the tax liability the spouse is relieved of exceeds $10,000, except as specified, and would require those amounts to be recomputed annually beginning on January 1, 2018, as specified. The bill would apply to court orders served or acknowledged on or after the effective date of this bill.","This bill amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to allow a court in a proceeding for dissolution of a marriage to determine the individual responsible for all or part of the tax liability on a joint return filed by a husband and wife. The tax liability on aggregate income is joint and several, but the amount of liability may not be reduced, but a court in a proceeding for dissolution of the marriage may determine that the individual responsible for all or part of the liability, provided the order revising the tax liability on the joint return: (1) must separately state the income tax liabilities for the taxable years for which revision of tax liability is granted; (2) may not revise a tax liability that has been fully paid prior to the effective date of the order; (3) shall become effective when the Franchise Tax Board is served with or acknowledges receipt of the order; and (4) shall not be effective if the gross income reportable on the return exceeds two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) or the amount of tax liability the spouse is relieved of exceeds ten thousand dollars ($$10,000), unless a tax revision clearance certificate is obtained from the Franchise Tax Board and filed with the court. The bill allows, whenever a joint return is filed by a husband and wife and the tax liability is not fully paid, that liability, including interest and penalties"
"Existing law, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, enacted by Proposition 47, as approved by the voters at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, among other things, established the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, which is funded by savings that accrue to the state from the implementation of the act. The act provides that, among other purposes, 25% of the funds shall be disbursed to the State Department of Education to administer a grant program to public agencies aimed at improving outcomes for public school pupils by reducing truancy and supporting pupils who are at risk of dropping out of school or are victims of crime.
This bill would establish the Learning Communities for School Success Program for the purpose of implementing that grant program, subject to an appropriation to the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund in the annual Budget Act or another statute for the purposes of the bill. The bill would specify the administrative duties and responsibilities of the department with respect to the program, including administering grants and coordinating assistance to local educational agencies, as defined. The bill would set forth criteria to guide the department in awarding grants under the program, and would specify the purposes for which grant funds may be used. The bill would require the department to submit a final evaluation of the program to the Legislature on or before January 31, 2020.
These provisions would become operative only if AB 1014 of the 2015–16 Regular Session is chaptered and becomes operative on or before January 1, 2017.","This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Department of Education, through the Learning Communities for School Success program, to administer grants and coordinate assistance to local educational agencies (LEAs) to support their identification and implementation of evidence-based, nonpunitive programs and practices that are aligned with the goals for pupil success contained in their local control and accountability plans. Each LEA that chooses to apply for funding under this program must include information about the department's plans for overall evaluation of its plans for achieving such goals."
"Existing law generally regulates the operation of bicycles, including, among other things, providing that a person operating a bicycle on the highway has all the rights and is subject to all the provisions applicable to the driver of a vehicle, including a prohibition against operating a bicycle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug. These provisions also apply to a pedicab, as defined. A violation of the provisions regulating the operation of a bicycle or pedicab is an offense.
This bill would expand the definition of a pedicab to include a 4-wheeled device that is primarily or exclusively pedal-powered, has a seating capacity for 8 or more passengers, cannot travel in excess of 15 miles per hour, and is being used for transporting passengers for hire, as prescribed. The bill would impose specified requirements on these pedicabs defined by the bill, relating to, among other things, a maximum seating capacity for 15 passengers, local authorization to operate, operator qualifications and training, safety equipment, inspections, financial responsibility, reporting of accidents to the Department of the California Highway Patrol, the loading and unloading of passengers, and general operation of pedicabs. The bill would, until January 1, 2020, establish requirements for pedicabs that allow passenger alcohol consumption. Because a violation of these provisions would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2015.

"(1) Existing law requires the governing board of a school district maintaining one or more high schools to appoint to its membership one or more nonvoting pupil members if pupils petition the governing board to make those appointments.
This bill would require the governing board of a school district to appoint the pupil member or members within 60 days of receiving the petition, or at its next regularly scheduled meeting if no meeting is held within those 60 days, as specified.
The bill would require a majority vote of all voting board members on a motion to eliminate the nonvoting or preferential voting pupil member position from the governing board of a school district, and would require the motion to be listed as a public agenda item for a meeting of the governing board of the school district prior to the motion being voted upon.
Because the bill would require school districts to provide a higher level of service, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Revises provisions regarding governing boards of school districts, including by: (1) requiring the governing board of a school district to consist of five members elected at large by the qualified voters of the district; (2) allowing a unified school district to have a governing board of seven members if the proposal for unification has specified such a board; and (3) requiring the governing board of an elementary school district other than a union or joint union elementary school district to consist of three members selected at large from the territory comprising the district whenever in any such elementary school district the average daily attendance during the preceding fiscal year is 300 or more. Specifies that: (1) there may be submitted to the governing board of a school district maintaining one or more high schools a pupil petition requesting that the governing board appoint one or more nonvoting pupil members to the board; and (2) there may also be submitted to the governing board of a school district maintaining one or more high schools a pupil petition requesting that the governing board allow preferential voting for the pupil member or members of the board."
"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, and under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing law authorizes certain ground emergency medical transportation providers to receive supplemental Medi-Cal reimbursement in addition to the rate of payment that the provider would otherwise receive for those services. Existing law provides that participation in the supplemental reimbursement program by an eligible provider is voluntary, and requires the nonfederal share of the supplemental reimbursement to be paid only with funds from specified governmental entities.
This bill would authorize the department to provide supplemental reimbursement under these provisions for the cost of paramedic services at a rate of payment equal to cost.
This bill would also require the department to design and implement an intergovernmental transfer (IGT) program in order to increase capitation payments to Medi-Cal managed care plans for covered ground emergency medical transportation services, as specified. The bill would require the department to implement the IGT program on
January 1,
July 1,
2016, or a later date if otherwise required pursuant to any necessary federal approvals obtained.

"Existing law provides for the establishment and operation of the Veterans’ Home of California at various sites, including homes in Barstow, Chula Vista, Lancaster, Ventura, and Yountville, and provides for an administrator for each home or homesite. Existing law defines “home” and “administrator” for these purposes. Existing law establishes the Veterans’ Home Fund in the State Treasury, which includes the proceeds of certain bonds. Existing law requires, upon appropriation of the Legislature, the Department of Veterans Affairs to use money in the fund for the purpose of designing and constructing veterans’ homes in California.
Existing law requires the administrator of a veterans’ home to maintain a Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund, which is required to be used, at the discretion of the administrator and subject to the approval of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, to provide for the general welfare of the veterans. Existing law specifies the moneys required to be deposited into the fund, and requires the administrator to prepare an itemized report for the expenditures made out of, and deposits made into, the fund. Under existing law, those reports are required to be submitted to the secretary, the fiscal committees of the Assembly and Senate, the committees of the Assembly and the Senate that have subject matter jurisdiction over veterans’ affairs, and the Veterans’ Home Allied Council on or before August 20 of each year.
This bill would create the Veterans’ Home Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Special Fund (MWR Fund), a continuously appropriated fund, in the State Treasury. The bill would require the administrator of a veterans’ home to deposit all moneys maintained by the administrator in an existing Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund into the statewide MWR Fund. The bill would require the administrator of each home to establish a Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Operating Fund (MWRO Fund) to administer quality of life activities for the general welfare of the residents and receive funds from the MWR Fund, as specified, and to establish an MWR Advisory Committee, as specified. The bill would require the department, in consultation with the MWR Advisory Committee, the Veterans’ Home Allied Council or the resident council of each home, to adopt regulations related to, among other things, administering the MWR Fund and the MWRO Funds and the process by which the homes submit and receive budget allocations. The bill would authorize the use of funds in the MWR Fund to provide for the general welfare of the residents of a home, as specified, and would specify restrictions on the use of those funds. The bill would require the department to annually determine the total amount for disbursement from the MWR Fund, and for that disbursement to be allocated proportionally to each home’s relative share of the total population of the entire veterans’ home system. The bill would authorize additional allocations to any veterans’ home if it is appropriate on the basis of factors including, but not limited to, the home’s unique age, size, population, and historical significance. The bill would authorize the administrator of a home to enter into an agreement with the Veterans’ Home Allied Council to operate facilities and activities that are related to authorized expenditures from the MWR Fund, as specified. The bill would require the department to prepare annual reports regarding moneys deposited into the MWR Fund and expenditure of those funds, as specified, and to submit the report on or before December 31 of each year to specified entities. The bill would require the department to maintain a $3,000,000 reserve in the MWR Fund and would authorize the department to invest moneys in the MWR Fund in the Surplus Money Investment Fund or by contracting with a third-party investment broker consistent with laws and regulations regarding selecting prudent, approved investment types.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 14, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to promulgate regulations related to the statewide Veterans Home Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund at each veterans home and authorizes the VA to establish similar policies and procedures at each such home. The bill creates the Veterans Home, Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund (MWR Fund) in the Treasury and requires all funds deposited in the MWR Fund to be continuously appropriated to the affected veterans homes without regard to fiscal year limitation. The VA shall distribute moneys in the MWR Fund to the homes to provide for the general welfare of the members of the homes. The VA shall annually determine the amount for disbursement from the MWR Fund to: a major augmentation of a home welfare system; and a resident augmentation of a home or maintenance or capital improvement request."
"(1) Under existing law, the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources in the Department of Conservation regulates the drilling, operation, maintenance, and abandonment of oil and gas wells in the state. Existing law requires the State Oil and Gas Supervisor to supervise the drilling, operation, maintenance, and abandonment of wells and the operation, maintenance, and removal or abandonment of tanks and facilities related to oil and gas production within an oil and gas field, so as to prevent damage to life, health, property, and natural resources, as provided; to permit owners and operators of wells to utilize all known methods and practices to increase the ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons; and to perform the supervisor’s duties in a manner that encourages the wise development of oil and gas resources to best meet oil and gas needs in this state.
This bill would no longer require the supervisor to perform his or her duties in that manner. The bill would instead require the supervisor to
authorize
supervise
the exploration and production of hydrocarbons, including, among other things, the drilling, operation, maintenance, and abandonment of wells,
and the
use of enhanced oil recovery methods, as defined,
and stimulation, as provided,
and
would
authorize the supervisor to allow an owner or operator of a well to drill, operate, maintain, and abandon wells utilizing all known methods and practices to increase the ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons if the supervisor finds that those methods and practices are consistent with existing law.
(2) Existing law requires the operator of a well to file a written notice of intention to commence drilling with, and prohibits any drilling until approval is given by, the supervisor or district deputy. Under existing law, the notice is deemed approved if the supervisor or district deputy fails to respond to the notice in writing within 10 working days from receipt and is deemed canceled if operations have not commenced within one year of receipt.
This bill would require an owner or operator of a well to file an application for approval to commence drilling, containing specified information, and would prohibit any drilling until written approval is given by the supervisor or the district deputy containing specified findings. The bill would authorize the supervisor, upon request, to grant a one-year extension if operations have not commenced within one year of the approval. The bill would require the applications and approvals by the supervisor or the district deputy to be posted on the division’s Internet Web site within 10 working days.
(3) The Permit Streamlining Act requires any public agency that is the lead agency for a development project to approve or disapprove of a project, as specified. Under that act, if the lead agency or responsible agency is required to provide public notice of the development project or to hold a public hearing on the development project, or both, and the agency has not provided the public notice or held the hearing, or both, at least 60 days prior to the expirations of specified time periods, the applicant may file an action to compel the agency to provide the public notice or hold the hearing, or both, as specified.
This bill would require the supervisor to perform his or her duties in conformance with that act.
(4) Existing law generally provides that well records filed by owners or operators with the supervisor are public records. However, existing law authorizes the supervisor, upon written request of an owner or operator, to maintain well records of exploratory wells, or other wells if the supervisor determines that there are extenuating circumstances, as confidential information. Under existing law, the confidential period for an onshore or offshore well is up to 2 or 5 years, respectively, from the cessation of drilling operations, as defined. Existing law authorizes the supervisor to extend the period of confidentiality of a well for 6 months upon written request documenting extenuating circumstances and requires that the total period of confidentiality, including all extensions, for onshore and offshore wells not exceed 4 or 7 years, respectively, from the cessation of drilling operations.
This bill would limit the authorization to maintain the confidentiality of well records to exploratory wells and only if the owner or operator includes specified information in the written request. The bill would deem both the request for, and the granting of, confidential well status to be public records and would require that information to be accessible on the division’s Internet Web site. The bill would require all well records of a confidential well, as defined, to be posted on the division’s Internet Web site within 10 working days once the confidential well period has ended. The bill would require that the confidential period for an offshore well not exceed 3 years from the cessation of drilling operations and would authorize the supervisor to extend the period of confidentiality for confidential wells for only 6 months, upon receiving a written request documenting extenuating circumstances.
(5) Existing law requires an owner or operator of a well to keep a log, core record, and history of the drilling of wells to be provided to the district deputy within 60 days after the date of cessation of drilling, rework, or abandonment operations or the date of suspension of operation. Under existing law, a person who fails to comply with this and other requirements relating to the regulation of oil or gas operations is guilty of a misdemeanor.
This bill would in addition require an owner or operator of a well to report specified information to the applicable regional water quality control board within 5 days of any loss of well and well casing integrity. Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(6) Existing law recognizes the Conservation Committee of California Oil and Gas Producers and authorizes it or any other committee of oil producers to make voluntary recommendations to the supervisor regarding, among other things, maximum efficient rates of production, as defined, if specified conditions are satisfied.
This bill would instead authorize any committee of oil producers to make recommendations to the supervisor regarding oil and gas exploration and production, as specified, and would require the division to post any recommendations received by the supervisor on the division’s Internet Web site.
(7) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Public Resources Code, with respect to oil and gas exploration and production, to require the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) supervisor to authorize the exploration and production of hydrocarbons, including drilling, stimulation, the use of enhanced oil recovery methods and well completion techniques, operation, tanks, maintenance, and abandonment of wells and the operation, maintenance, and removal or abandonment of strata and facilities attendant to oil and gas production, including pipelines not subject to Government regulation. The BLM supervisor may: (1) allow an owner or operator of a well to drill, operate, maintain, and abandon such wells utilizing all methods known to the oil industry to increase the ultimate recovery of underground hydrocarbons if the BLM supervisor finds that such methods and practices are consistent with this section; and (2) require an operator to implement a monitoring program to detect releases to groundwater and surface water for aboveground oil production tanks and facilities."
"Existing law, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), requires the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a process for the annual review of unreasonable increases in premiums for health insurance coverage in which health insurance issuers submit to the secretary and the relevant state a justification for an unreasonable premium increase prior to implementation of the increase. The PPACA imposes an excise tax on a provider of applicable employer-sponsored health care coverage, if the aggregate cost of that coverage provided to an employee exceeds a specified dollar limit.
Existing state law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance.
Existing law requires a health care service plan or health insurer in the individual, small group, or large group markets to file rate information with the Department of Managed Health Care or the Department of Insurance. For large group plan contracts and policies, existing law requires a plan or insurer to file rate information with the respective department at least 60 days prior to implementing an unreasonable rate increase, as defined in PPACA. Existing law requires the plan or insurer to also disclose specified aggregate data with that rate filing. Existing law authorizes the respective department to review those filings, to report to the Legislature at least quarterly on all unreasonable rate filings, and to post on its Internet Web site a decision that an unreasonable rate increase is not justified or that a rate filing contains inaccurate information. Existing law requires prior notice, as specified, of changes to premium rates or coverage in order for those changes to be effective.
This bill would add to the existing rate information requirement to further require large group health care service plans and health insurers to file with the respective department the weighted average rate increase for all large group benefit designs during the 12-month period ending January 1 of the following calendar year. The bill would require the notice of changes to premium rates or coverage for large group health plans and insurance policies to provide additional information regarding whether the rate change is greater than average rate increases approved by the California Health Benefit Exchange or by the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System, or would be subject to the excise tax described above. The bill would require the plan or insurer to file additional aggregate rate information with the respective department on or before October 1, 2016, and annually thereafter. The bill would require the respective department to conduct a public meeting regarding large group rate changes. The bill would require these meetings to occur annually after the respective department has reviewed the large group rate information required to be submitted annually by the plan or insurer, as specified. The bill would authorize a health care service plan or health insurer that exclusively contracts with no more than 2 medical groups to provide or arrange for professional medical services for enrollees or insureds to meet this requirement by disclosing its actual trend experience for the prior year using benefit categories that are the same or similar to those used by other plans or health insurers.
Because a willful violation of the bill’s requirements by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Health and Safety Code to prohibit any change in premium rates or changes in coverage stated in a group health care service plan contract from becoming effective unless the plan has delivered in writing a notice indicating the change or changes at least 60 days prior to the contract renewal effective date. The notice must include: (1) whether the rate proposed to be in effect is greater than the average rate increase for individual market products negotiated by the California Health Benefit Exchange for the most recent calendar year for which the rates are final; (2) whether the rate proposed to be in effect is greater than the average rate increase negotiated by the Board of Administration of the Public Employees Retirement System for the most recent calendar year for which the rates are final; and (3) whether the rate change includes any portion of the excise tax paid by the plan. A health care service plan that declines to offer coverage to or denies enrollment for a large group must, at the time of the denial, provide the applicant with the specific reason or reasons for the decision in writing. (Sec. 2) Each health plan must file with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the weighted average rate increase for all large group benefit designs during the 12-month period ending January 1 of the following calendar year.

"Existing law establishes the California Health and Human Services Agency consisting of the Departments of Aging, Child Support Services, Community Services and Development, Developmental Services, Health Care Services, Managed Health Care, Public Health, Rehabilitation, Social Services, and State Hospitals, among other entities.
Existing law sets forth legislative findings and declarations regarding long-term care services, including that consumers of those services experience great differences in service levels, eligibility criteria, and service availability that often result in inappropriate and expensive care that is not responsive to individual needs. Those findings and declarations also state that the laws governing long-term care facilities have established an uncoordinated array of long-term care services that are funded and administered by a state structure that lacks necessary integration and focus.
This bill, among other things, would create the Statewide Aging and Long-Term Care Services Coordinating Council, chaired by the Secretary of California Health and Human Services, and would consist of the heads, or their designated representative, of specified departments and offices. The secretary would have specified responsibilities, including, but not limited to, leading the council in the development of a state aging and long-term care services strategic plan to address how the state will meet the needs of the aging population in the years 2020, 2025, and 2030. The bill would require the strategic plan to be submitted to the Secretary of the Senate, the Chief Clerk of the Assembly, and the chairs of specified policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature by July 1, 2018. The bill would authorize the Secretary of California Health and Human Services to accept grants or donations, real or in-kind, to support the operation of the Statewide Aging and Long-Term Care Services Coordinating Council and the development of the state aging and long-term care services strategic plan.",This bill establishes a Statewide Aging and Long-Term Care Services Coordinating Council within the California Health and Human Services Agency. The council must develop a strategic plan to address the needs of the aging population in California.
"Existing law, the California Child Day Care Facilities Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of family day care homes by the State Department of Social Services. Existing law, the Child Care and Development Services Act, administered by the State Department of Education, requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to administer child care and development programs that offer a full range of services for eligible children from infancy to 13 years of age, including, among others, resource and referral programs, alternative payment programs, and family child care home education networks.
This bill would require the State Department of Education to ensure that all family child care providers, as defined, attend an in-person orientation training, as provided. The bill would require the orientation training to include at least 4 hours of instruction and include specified information, including minimum health and safety standards, as provided. The bill would authorize the Superintendent to adopt rules and regulations regarding the orientation training.
The bill would require the State Department of Social Services and the State Department of Education, with the assistance of specified state departments and agencies, and their contractors and subcontractors, to make specified information regarding family child care providers available to provider organizations, and would require the provider organization requesting the information to bear the costs of collecting the information, as provided.
The bill would provide that the above provisions are contingent upon an appropriation of funds for these purposes in the annual Budget Act or another statute.","(Sec. 1) Directs the State Department of Education to ensure that all family child care providers attend in-person orientation training within three months after program participation. Defines a &quot;family child care provider&quot; as a child care provider that participates in a state-funded child care program and is either: (1) licensed pursuant to the Health and Safety Code; or (2) licensed through the State Department of Social Services, or another State department, agency, or political subdivision to subsidize early learning and care for children, but not including the public education system. Requires an individual who meets both requirements to be exempt from licensing requirements.(Sec. 2) Directs the State Department of Social Services, the State Department of Education, or another State department, agency, or political subdivision to create a list of all family child care providers who participate in the state-funded child care program and make such list available to provider organizations.

"The California Constitution authorizes the Legislature to permit private, nonprofit, eligible organizations to conduct raffles as a funding mechanism to support beneficial and charitable works, if, among other conditions, at least 90% of the gross receipts from the raffle go directly to beneficial or charitable purposes in California. The California Constitution further authorizes the Legislature to amend the percentage of gross receipts required to be dedicated to beneficial or charitable purposes by a statute passed by a
2/3
vote of each house of the Legislature. Existing statutory law implements those provisions and requires the Department of Justice to administer and enforce those provisions.
This bill would authorize a major league sports raffle at a home game conducted by an eligible organization, as defined, for the purpose of directly supporting specified beneficial or charitable purposes in California, or financially supporting another private, nonprofit, eligible organization, as defined, that performs those purposes if, among other requirements, each ticket sold contains a unique and matching identifier, 50% of the gross receipts generated from the sale of raffle tickets are used to benefit or provide support for beneficial or charitable purposes, as defined, the other 50% is paid to the winner, and the winners of the prizes are determined by a manual draw, as specified. The bill would authorize an electronic device to be used to sell tickets. The bill would prohibit the use of a random number generator for the manual draw or sale of tickets. This bill would define an eligible organization as a private, nonprofit organization established by, or affiliated with, a team from specified sports organizations that has been qualified to conduct business in California for at least one year before conducting a raffle and is exempt from taxation pursuant to specified provisions of federal and California law.
The bill would require, if an eligible organization conducts a raffle for purposes of financially supporting another private, nonprofit, eligible organization, the eligible organization conducting the raffle to distribute to the other eligible organization all proceeds not paid out to the winners within 15 days of conducting the raffle. The bill would require an eligible organization to disclose to all ticket purchasers the designated private, nonprofit organization for which the raffle is being conducted.
This bill would also prohibit an eligible organization from conducting a raffle, and a manufacturer or distributor of raffle-related products or services from conducting business with an eligible organization for purposes of conducting a raffle pursuant to these provisions, without first having obtained and thereafter maintained a registration from the Department of Justice, as specified. Once registered, the bill would require an eligible organization to file annually thereafter with the department a report that includes specified information for each of the eligible organization’s last 3 fiscal years, and would require the department to make those reports available online, as provided. This bill would require the department to adopt, on or before June 1, 2016, regulations to enforce these provisions, would authorize the department to assess annual registration fees, as specified, to be deposited in the General Fund to cover the reasonable costs of establishing and operating this registration system, and would require the department to maintain a database of registrants and conduct specified proceedings in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act.

"Existing law, the California Safe Drinking Water Act, provides for the operation of public water systems and imposes on the State Water Resources Control Board various responsibilities and duties. The act authorizes the state board to order consolidation with a receiving water system where a public water system, or a state small water system within a disadvantaged community, consistently fails to provide an adequate supply of safe drinking water. The act authorizes the state board to order the extension of service to an area that does not have access to an adequate supply of safe drinking water so long as the extension of service is an interim extension of service in preparation for consolidation. Existing law, for these purposes, defines “disadvantaged community” to mean a disadvantaged community that is in an unincorporated area or is served by a mutual water company.
This bill would authorize the state board to order consolidation where a public water system or a state small water system is serving, rather than within, a disadvantaged community, and would limit the authority of the state board to order consolidation or extension of service to provide that authority only with regard to a disadvantaged community. This bill would make a community disadvantaged for these purposes if the community is in a mobilehome park, even if it is not in an unincorporated area or served by a mutual water company.
The act requires the state board, before ordering consolidation or extension of service, to take certain actions, including consulting with specified entities, to hold at least one initial public meeting, as specified, and to obtain written consent from any domestic well owner for consolidation or extension of service. The act provides that any affected resident within the consolidation or extended service area who does not provide written consent is ineligible, until consent is provided, for any future water-related grant funding from the state, except as specified.
This bill would also require the state board, before ordering consolidation or extension of service, to consult with public water systems in the chain of distribution of the potentially receiving water system. The bill would provide that an initial public meeting is not required for a potentially subsumed area that is served only by domestic wells. The bill would apply to the domestic well owner, instead of to an affected resident, within the consolidation or extended service area the written consent requirement for eligibility for water-related grant funding.
The act requires the state board, upon ordering the consolidation or extension of service, to adequately compensate the owners of a privately owned subsumed water system for the fair market value of the system as determined by the Public Utilities Commission for water corporations subject to the commission’s jurisdiction or the state board for all other systems. The act prohibits a consolidated water system from increasing charges on existing customers of the receiving water system solely as a consequence of the consolidation or extension of service unless the customer receives a corresponding benefit.
This bill would instead authorize the Public Utilities Commission or the state board to determine the fair market value of a subsumed water system, without regard to whether the system is a water corporation subject to the commission’s jurisdiction. The bill would prohibit fees or charges imposed on a customer of a subsumed water system from exceeding the cost of consolidating the water system or the cost of extension of service to the area.
The act exempts the consolidation or extension of service pursuant to these provisions from the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000, which governs the procedures for the formation and change of organization of cities and special districts.
This bill would instead exempt an action taken by the state board pursuant to these provisions from the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000.
This bill would authorize the state board, for the purpose of providing affordable, safe drinking water to disadvantaged communities and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse, to contract with an administrator to provide administrative and managerial services to a designated water system and to order the designated public water system to accept those services if sufficient funding is available and if the state board makes a certain finding. The bill would define designated water system as a public water system that serves a disadvantaged community and that the state board finds consistently fails to provide an adequate and affordable supply of safe drinking water. The bill would require the state board to provide a public water system with notice, as specified, and to conduct a public meeting, as specified, before determining that the public water system is a designated public water system. The bill would authorize the administrator of a designated public water system to expend available moneys for capital infrastructure improvements that the designated public water system needs to provide an adequate and affordable supply of safe drinking water, to set and collect user water rates and fees, and to expend available moneys for the operation and maintenance costs of the designated public water system. The bill would require the state board to work with the administrator of the public water system and the communities served by that designated public water system to develop, within the shortest feasible timeframe, adequate technical, managerial, and financial capacity to deliver safe drinking water so that the services of the administrator are no longer necessary. The bill would not apply these administrator provisions to a charter city, charter county, or charter city and county.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 116681 of the Health and Safety Code proposed by AB 1611 and SB 839 that would become operative if this bill and one or both of those bills are enacted and this bill is chaptered last.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Health and Safety Code to allow the California State Water Resources Control Board to order consolidation of public water systems so long as the extension of service is an interim extension in preparation for consolidation. The consolidation may be physical or operational. The board shall: (1) encourage, and fully consider input from, the relevant local agency formation commission regarding the provision of water service in the affected area, the recommendations for improving service in a municipal service review, and any other relevant information; and (2) also order consolidation with a receiving water system as provided in this section. The board may also order the extension of service to an area within a disadvantaged community that does not have access to an adequate supply of safe drinking water so long as the extension is an interim extension of service in preparation for consolidation."
"Existing law requires the state to achieve a 20% reduction in urban per capita water use in California by December 31, 2020, and requires the state to make incremental progress towards this goal by reducing per capita water use by at least 10% on or before December 31, 2015. Existing law requires each urban retail water supplier to develop urban water use targets and an interim urban water use target, in accordance with specified requirements.
This bill would require each urban retail water supplier, on or before October 1, 2017, and on or before October 1 of each year thereafter, to submit a completed and validated water loss audit report for the previous calendar year or previous fiscal year as prescribed by rules adopted by the Department of Water Resources on or before January 1, 2017, and updated as provided. The bill would require the department to post all validated water loss audit reports on its Internet Web site in a manner that allows for comparisons across water suppliers and to make these reports available for public viewing. This bill would require the department to provide technical assistance to guide urban retail water suppliers’ water loss detection programs. The bill would require the State Water Resources Control Board, no earlier than January 1, 2019, and no later than July 1, 2020, to adopt rules requiring urban retail water suppliers to meet performance standards for the volume of water losses. This bill would require the board to contribute up to $400,000 using funds available for the 2016–17 fiscal year towards procuring water loss audit report validation assistance for urban retail water suppliers.","This bill requires the Department of the Interior, by January 1, 2017, to adopt rules for: the conduct of standardized water loss audits by urban retail water suppliers in accordance with the method adopted by the American Water Works Association in the third edition of Water Audits and Loss Control Programs, Manual M36 and in the Free Water Audit Software; the process for validating a water loss audit report prior to submitting such report to Interior; and the method for submitting such report.

This bill would additionally require a licensing board to submit personal information regarding licensees, described above, to the Employment Development Department.
(2) The Contractors’ State License Law provides for the licensure and regulation of contractors by the Contractors’ State License Board within the Department of Consumer Affairs.

Existing law permits a governmental agency to solicit proposals and enter into agreements with private entities for the design, construction, or reconstruction by, and may lease to, private entities, for specified types of fee-producing infrastructure projects. Existing law permits these agreements to provide for the lease of, or ownership of, infrastructure facilities owned by a governmental entity, but constructed by a private entity, to that private entity for a period of up to 35 years.
This bill, notwithstanding the act and any other law, would authorize the City of Long Beach to contract and procure a project for the revitalization and redevelopment of the Long Beach Civic Center, as defined, in accordance with prescribed procedures for proposal evaluation and contract award. The bill would authorize the lease of all or a portion of the project to, or ownership by, a private entity or entities, for a term of up to 50 years. The bill would make a statement that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique and special circumstances surrounding the existing Long Beach Civic Center, and the need to immediately, quickly, and efficiently develop the project, and to resolve property issues potentially delaying the project.","Amends Federal law to authorize the city of Long Beach, California, to contract and procure the project for the revitalization and redevelopment of the Long Beach Civic Center through a public-private partnership with a private entity or other entities whose proposal is, or proposals are, judged as providing the best value in meeting the best interests of the city.

Existing law establishes timeframes for an employer to make a determination regarding a physician’s request. Existing law requires the utilization review process to be governed by written policies and procedures, and requires that these policies and procedures be filed with the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers’ Compensation and disclosed by the employer to employees, physicians, and the public upon request.
This bill would prohibit the employer, or any entity conducting utilization review on behalf of the employer, from offering or providing any financial incentive or consideration to a physician based on the number of modifications, delays, or denials made by the physician. The bill would authorize the administrative director to review any compensation agreement, payment schedule, or contract between the employer, or any entity conducting utilization review on behalf of the employer, and the utilization review physician. The bill would make any information disclosed to the administrative director confidential and not subject to public disclosure, except as specified.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","Amends the Labor Code to require every employer to establish a utilization review process in compliance with this Act, either directly or through its insurer or an entity with which an employer or insurer contracts for these services. Specifies that each utilization review process shall be governed by written policies and procedures which shall ensure that decisions based on the medical necessity to cure and relieve proposed medical treatment services are consistent with the schedule for medical treatment utilization adopted pursuant to this Act. Specifies that if an employer, insurer, or other entity requests medical information from a physician in order to determine whether to approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for authorization, the employer shall request only the information reasonably necessary to make the determination.

"Existing law, the California Public Records Act, requires state and local agencies to make their records available for public inspection, unless an exemption from disclosure applies. The act declares that access to information concerning the conduct of the people’s business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.

This bill would require a Chief Data Officer to be appointed by the Governor, on or before July 1, 2016, subject to Senate confirmation. The Chief Data Officer would report to the Secretary of Government Operations. The bill would require the Chief Data Officer to, among other things, create the statewide open data portal, as defined, to provide public access to data sets from agencies within the state. The bill would require each agency, as defined, to publish a summary listing of all of its available data sets on the portal. The bill would also require state agencies identified by the Chief Data Officer to appoint a data coordinator who would be responsible for compliance with these provisions. The bill would require any data published on the statewide open data portal or other open data portal operated by an agency to comply with all state and federal privacy laws and regulations.
The bill would prohibit these provisions from affecting the obligation of an agency to provide notices or information to the public.","This bill requires the Chief Data Officer, who shall be appointed by the governor, to: (1) create an inventory of all available data in California, (2) create a statewide open data portal that is accessible to the public, and (3) publish a listing of all data that may be provided to the public and a roadmap describing the process by which 100% of the data held by an agency will be made publicly available, subject to state or federal privacy laws or regulations.

"(1) Existing law prohibits an employer who employs 25 or more employees working at the same location from discharging or discriminating against an employee who is a parent, guardian, or grandparent having custody of a child in a licensed child day care facility or in kindergarten or grades 1 to 12, inclusive, for taking off up to 40 hours each year for the purpose of participating in school activities, subject to specified conditions. Existing law requires an employee to provide documentation regarding these activities upon request by an employer and provides remedies to employees discharged, demoted, or in any other manner discriminated against as a result of his or her exercise of this right to take time off.
This bill would revise references to a child day care facility to instead refer to a child care provider. The bill would include the addressing of a child care provider emergency or a school emergency, as defined, and the finding, enrolling, or reenrolling of a child in a school or with a child care provider as activities for which a parent having custody of a child shall not be discriminated against or discharged, as described above. The bill would define “parent” for these purposes as a parent, guardian, stepparent, foster parent, or grandparent of, or a person who stands in loco parentis to, a child, thereby extending these protections to an employee who is a stepparent or foster parent or who stands in loco parentis to a child.
(2) Existing law requires an employer who provides sick leave for employees to permit an employee to use the employee’s accrued and available sick leave entitlement to attend to the illness of a child, parent, spouse, or domestic partner and prohibits an employer from denying an employee the right to use sick leave or taking specific discriminatory action against an employee for using, or attempting to exercise the right to use, sick leave to attend to such an illness. Existing law defines “sick leave” for these purposes as leave provided for use by the employee during an absence from employment for specified reasons, including, but not limited to, an employee’s inability to perform his or her duties due to illness, injury, or a medical condition of the employee. The Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014 requires an employer, upon the request of an employee, to provide paid sick days for a victim of domestic violence or the diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, the employee or the employee’s family member, which is defined as including, in addition to the above-described relatives, grandparents, grandchildren, and siblings.
This bill would instead require an employer to permit an employee to use sick leave for the purposes specified in the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act of 2014, would redefine “sick leave” as leave provided for use by the employee during an absence from employment for these purposes, and would prohibit an employer from denying an employee the right to use sick leave or taking specific discriminatory action against an employee for using, or attempting to exercise the right to use, sick leave for these purposes.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Labor Code to prohibit certain employers who employ 25 or more employees working at the same location from discharging or discriminating against an employee who is a parent of one or more children of the age to attend kindergarten or grades one to 12, inclusive, or a licensed child care provider, for taking off up to 40 hours each year, for the purpose of either of the following child-related activities: (1) finding, enrolling, or reenrolling his or her child in a school or with a licensed child care provider, or participating in activities of the school or licensed child care provider of his or her child; and (2) addressing a child care provider or school emergency. Applies such prohibition to employers who employ more than one parent of a child at the same worksite, only to the parent who first gives notice to the employer, such that another parent may take a planned absence simultaneously as to that same child under such conditions only if he or she obtains the employer's approval for the requested time off. Declares that the entitlement of any employee under this Act shall not be diminished by any collective bargaining agreement entered into before January 1, 1995. Declares that, in the event that all permanent, full-time employees of an employer are accorded vacation"
"(1) Existing law declares the intent of the Legislature to preserve, upgrade, and expand the supply of housing to persons and families of low or moderate income, through the sale of specified surplus residential property owned by public agencies. Existing law establishes priorities and procedures that any state agency disposing of that surplus residential property is required to follow. Under existing law, specified single-family residences must first be offered to their former owners or present occupants, as specified. If the property is not sold to a former owner or present occupant, existing law requires that the property be offered to a housing-related private or public entity at a reasonable price for either limited equity cooperative housing or low and moderate income rental or owner-occupied housing, as specified.
This bill would authorize a local housing authority to purchase and rehabilitate surplus residential property within Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra, La Cañada Flintridge, and the 90032 postal ZIP Code. The local housing authority would be required to dedicate any profits realized from a subsequent sale to the construction of affordable housing. The bill would also require that, prior to offering the property to a housing-related private or public entity as specified above, that property that is a historic home, as defined, be first offered to a housing-related public entity or a nonprofit private entity dedicated to rehabilitating and maintaining the historic home for public and community access and use.
(2) Existing law requires the Department of Transportation to deposit proceeds from sales of surplus residential property into the SR-710 Rehabilitation Account, a continuously appropriated fund, to be distributed, as specified, exclusively to fund projects located in Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra, La Cañada Flintridge, and the 90032 postal ZIP Code.
This bill would specifically require the department to deposit proceeds from the sale of surplus residential property from the department to a new owner in the SR-710 Rehabilitation Account. This bill would establish the Affordable Housing Trust Account within the Housing Finance Fund and require the net proceeds from a subsequent market sale of surplus residential property sold pursuant to these provisions at an affordable or reasonable price, as specified, be deposited in this account. The bill would continuously appropriate funds in this account to the California Housing Finance Agency to carry out specified activities for the benefit of persons residing exclusively within Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra, La Cañada Flintridge, and the 90032 postal ZIP Code.
(3) This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for Pasadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra, La Cañada Flintridge, and the 90032 postal ZIP Code.
(4) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","Amends Federal law to revise Federal requirements for the disposal of surplus residential property. <n>Directs a State agency disposing of surplus residential property to offer all single-family residences presently occupied by their former owners at the appraised fair market value to: (1) those former owners; (2) all single-family residences presently occupied by their former owners who have occupied the property two years or more and who are persons and families of low or moderate income; (3) all single-family residences to their present occupants who have occupied the property five years or more and whose household income does not exceed 150 percent of the area median income; and (4) all single-family residences to present occupants who are not the former owners who have had an ownership interest in real property in the last three years. <n>Requires the price of such single-family residences to be at least the price paid by the agency for original acquisition, unless the acquisition price was greater than the current fair market value and shall not be greater than fair market value.

"The California Constitution generally limits ad valorem taxes on real property to 1% of the full cash value, as defined, of that property, and provides that the full cash value base may be adjusted each year by an inflationary rate not to exceed 2% for any given year. Existing property tax law implementing this constitutional authority provides that the taxable value of real property is the lesser of its base year value compounded annually by the inflation factor not to exceed 2%, as provided, or its full cash value. Existing property tax law also provides that the taxable value of a manufactured home is the lesser of its base year value compounded annually by an inflation factor not to exceed 2% or its full cash value.
This bill would provide that the inflation factor shall not apply to the principal place of
residence
residence, as specified,
of a “qualified taxpayer,” defined by the bill to mean a person who owns a dwelling as his or her principal place of residence, or a person who owns a manufactured home as his or her principal place of residence, who is 65 years of age or older on the lien date who meets specified requirements.
By changing the manner in which local tax officials calculate the taxable value of real property owned by senior citizens, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.
This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","This bill amends the Revenue and Taxation Code, with respect to the tax treatment of real property in California, to provide that the taxable value of real property shall, except for the area of land surrounding it as is reasonably necessary for use as a home, be the lesser of: (1) its base year value compounded annually since the base year by an inflation factor; or (2) the percentage change in the cost of living, as determined by the California Department of Industrial Relations. The percentage increase for any assessment year commencing before January 1, 1985, shall be the percentage change in the cost of living as determined by such Department. For any assessment year commencing after January 1, 1985, and before January 1, 1998, the inflation factor shall be the percentage change, rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of 1% from December of the prior fiscal year to December of the current fiscal year in the California Consumer Price Index for all items. The percentage increase for any assessment year commencing on or after January 1, 1998, shall not exceed 2% of the prior year's value."
"The Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law, the violation of which is a crime, imposes a tax of $0.87 per package of 20 cigarettes on every distributor of cigarettes and a tax on the wholesale cost of tobacco products distributed at a tax rate that is equivalent to the combined rate of all taxes imposed on cigarettes, and at a rate equivalent to $0.50 per pack cigarette tax. Revenues from taxes imposed under this law are deposited in specified accounts. These taxes are inclusive of the taxes imposed under the Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act of 1988 (Proposition 99) and the California Children and Families Act of 1998 (Proposition 10).
This bill, beginning January 1, 2016, would impose an additional tax on the distribution of cigarettes at the rate of $0.10 for each cigarette distributed, which would be $2.00 per pack; would require a dealer and a wholesaler to file a return with the State Board of Equalization showing the number of cigarettes in its possession or under its control on that date, and impose a related floor stock tax; and would require a licensed cigarette distributor to file a return with the board and pay a cigarette indicia adjustment tax at the rate equal to the difference between the existing tax rate and the tax rate imposed by this bill for cigarette tax stamps in its possession or under its control on that date. Because the bill would impose an additional tax on cigarettes under the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law, it would increase the tax upon the distribution of tobacco products under that law.
The bill would provide that the revenues collected from the additional tax be deposited in the California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 Fund created by this bill, and transferred into accounts within that fund, which are created by this bill, the Tobacco Prevention and Education Account, the Tobacco Disease Related Health Care Account, and the Tobacco Law Enforcement Account. The bill would provide that revenue from this tax would not be considered General Fund revenue, and would limit the use or loan of those revenues, as provided.
Because this bill would impose new requirements under the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law, the violation of which is a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
This bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIII A of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of
2/3

This bill would become operative only if AB 1396 of the 2015–16 Regular Session is also enacted and takes effect on or before January 1, 2016.",". The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the excise tax on cigarettes and tobacco products, to increase the rate of such tax to $1 per pack of cigarettes and to $3 per pack of tobacco products.

Existing law requires the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to submit a final report of the findings from its evaluation of the pilot program to the Legislature and the Governor by a specified date.
This bill would require the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to submit a final report of the findings from its evaluation of the Case Management Reentry Pilot Program to the Legislature and the Governor by no later than July 31, 2017.
The bill would also require the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to develop a Data Dashboard on a quarterly basis containing specified information regarding each institution, including, among other information, the total budget, including actual expenditures, staff vacancies and the number of authorized staff positions, overtime, sick leave, and the number of use of force incidents, and to post those reports on the department’s Internet Web site, as provided.","This bill amends the Penal Code to direct the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to establish a case management reentry pilot program for state prisoners who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year and who are likely to benefit from a case management reentry strategy designed to address homelessness, joblessness, mental disorders, and developmental disabilities among offenders transitioning from prison into the community.

"Existing law establishes the California Insurance Guarantee Association to provide coverage against losses arising from the failure of an insolvent property, casualty, or workers’ compensation insurer to discharge its obligations under its insurance policies. Existing law requires the association to pay and discharge all “covered claims,” which includes the obligations of the insolvent insurer.
This bill would additionally provide that a “covered claim” includes a claim filed by an employee of a general employer that has entered into a contractual relationship with a special employer that is a self-insured governmental entity. The bill would provide that in that case, if certain criteria are met, the contractual agreement would be conclusive proof that the special employer never intended to provide workers’ compensation insurance for the employees of the general employer.","Amends Federal law regarding workers compensation to require that covered claims of an insolvent insurer, including the obligation for unearned premiums, include the obligations of an insolvent insurer, including the obligation for unearned premiums, that are presented as a claim to the association in the state of domicile of the insolvent insurer or to the association on or before the last date fixed for the filing of claims in the domiciliary liquidating proceedings. (Current law requires that covered claims include obligations of an insolvent insurer, including the obligation for unearned premiums, when the policy was issued or when the insured event occurred, and when an order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency has been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, or, in the case of the State Compensation Insurance Fund, if a finding of insolvency agreement is made by a duly enacted legislative measure.) Declares that the people of California do enact this Act."
"Existing law requires a court to assign counsel to defend a defendant if the defendant desires the assistance of counsel and cannot afford to pay for counsel. Upon conclusion of the proceedings against the defendant, or withdrawal of counsel, existing law authorizes the court to make a determination of the ability of a defendant to pay all or a portion of his or her defense. Existing law authorizes the court to order a defendant to reimburse the county for those costs. Existing law provides a presumption that a defendant sentenced to state prison is determined not to have a reasonably discernible future financial ability to reimburse the costs of his or her defense, except as specified.
This bill would extend that presumption to a defendant sentenced to county jail for a period longer than 364 days.","Amends the California criminal code to allow a court, upon a finding that a defendant is entitled to counsel but unable to employ counsel, to hold a hearing or, in its discretion, order the defendant to appear before a county officer designated by the court to determine whether the defendant owns or has an interest in any real property or other assets subject to attachment and not otherwise exempt by law. Allows the court to impose a lien on any real property owned by the defendant or in which the defendant has an interest, to be recorded with the county recorder in the county or counties in which the property is located, and to have priority over subsequently recorded liens or encumbrances. Specifies that the county shall have the right to enforce its lien for the payment of providing legal assistance to an indigent defendant in the same manner as other by way of a writ of attachment, except that a county may not enforce its lien on the defendant's principal place of residence pursuant to a writ of execution.

The prima facie limit also applies when approaching or passing school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with a standard “SCHOOL” warning sign. A violation of that prima facie limit is an infraction.
Existing law additionally allows a city or county to establish in a residence district, on a highway with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, a 15 miles per hour prima facie limit when approaching, at a distance of less than 500 feet from, or passing, a school building or the grounds thereof, contiguous to a highway and posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 15 miles per hour, while children are going to or leaving the school, either during school hours or during the noon recess period. The prima facie limit would also apply when approaching, at that same distance, or passing school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with one of those signs.
Existing law additionally allows a city or county to establish in a residence district, on a highway with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, a 25 miles per hour prima facie speed limit when approaching at a distance of 500 to 1,000 feet from a school building or grounds thereof, contiguous to a highway and posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 25 miles per hour, while children are going to or leaving the school, either during school hours or during the noon recess period. The prima facie limit would also apply when approaching, at that same distance, or passing school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with one of those signs.
This bill would allow a city or county to establish in a residence district, on a highway with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, a 15 miles per hour prima facie speed limit when approaching, at a distance of less than 1,320 feet from, or passing, a school building or grounds thereof, contiguous of to a highway and posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 15 miles per hour 24 hours a day. This bill would provide that a 25 miles per hour prima facie limit in a residence district, on a highway, with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, applies, as to those local authorities, when approaching, at a distance of 500 to 1,320 feet from a school building or grounds thereof. This bill would also authorize a local authority, on the basis of an engineering and traffic survey, to extend the maximum distance to establish a prima facie speed limit and school warning signs, as specified. This bill would also allow the 15 miles per hour or 25 miles per hour prima facie speed limit to apply 24 hours a day.
By authorizing a change in the prima facie limits, the bill would expand the scope of an existing crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Vehicle Code to allow a local government, whenever it determines that the prima facie speed limit of 25 miles per hour established by this Act is more than is reasonable or safe, to determine and declare a prima facie speed limit of: (1) 20 or 15 miles per hour, whichever is justified as the appropriate speed limit by that survey; and (2) 15 miles per hour in a residence district, on a highway with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, when approaching, at a distance of less than 500 1,320 feet from, or passing, a school building or the grounds of a school building, contiguous to a highway and posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 15 miles per hour while children are going to or leaving the school, either during school hours or during the noon recess period. Applies such prima facie limits only to highways that meet the following conditions: (1) a maximum of two traffic lanes; (2) a maximum posted 30 miles per hour prima facie speed limit immediately before and after the school zone; and (3) the prima facie limits to all lanes of an affected highway, in both directions of travel. Declares that a local authority may, upon the basis of an engineering and travel survey documenting school attendance boundaries or travel patterns"
"Under existing law, the segments of postsecondary education in this state include the University of California, the California State University, the California Community Colleges, independent institutions of higher education, and private postsecondary educational institutions.
Existing law, the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009, provides, among other things, for student protections and regulatory oversight of private postsecondary institutions in the state. The act is enforced by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education within the Department of Consumer Affairs. The act exempts specified institutions from its provisions, does not apply to private postsecondary educational institutions that do not maintain a physical presence in the state, and is repealed on January 1, 2017.
The act defines “private postsecondary educational institution” for these purposes.
This bill would authorize the Governor to enter into an interstate reciprocity agreement for purposes of oversight of postsecondary educational institutions offering postsecondary education in states in which they maintain no physical presence, as specified.
This bill would, to the extent authorized by federal law, apply the act to an accredited private entity with no physical presence in this state that offers and awards degrees to the public in this state by means of distance education for an institutional charge if the entity does not participate in a regional state authorization reciprocity agreement entered into or recognized by the state pursuant to specified law. The bill would authorize the Department of Consumer Affairs to enter into a regional state authorization reciprocity agreement with other states through a compact on behalf of this state. The compact would provide that an entity regulated in one member state would be able to provide distance education in other member states. The bill would require the bureau, before entering into a compact, to establish a process to ensure that certain educational institutions that are exempt from the act may participate in the state authorization reciprocity agreement without impacting their exempt status. The bill would require the bureau to enter into a memorandum of understanding with certain educational officials for the purpose of establishing and implementing the state authorization reciprocity agreement, as specified. The bill would authorize the bureau to establish a reasonable fee to be paid to the Department of Consumer Affairs by a participating postsecondary institution, as specified.","(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Education Code to authorize the Department of Education's Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education to enter into a regional state authorization reciprocity agreement with other states through a compact on behalf of California. The Bureau must: establish a process to ensure that educational institutions exempt from the California Private Postsecondary Act of 2009 may participate in the agreement without impacting their exempt status; and enter into a memorandum of understanding with the President of the University of California, the Chancellor of the California State University, and the presidents of the independent California colleges and universities as represented by the state association representing the largest number of those members, to ensure that students enrolled in private postsecondary educational institutions without a physical presence in this state are provided at least with a similar level of consumer protection as would be provided if the institutions were regulated by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education. The governor of California may enter into an interstate reciprocity agreement for oversight of postsecondary educational institutions offering postsecondary education in states in which they maintain no physical presence, provided that such agreement ensures that students enrolled in private postsecondary educational institutions without a physical presence in this state are provided at least with a similar level of consumer protection as would be provided if the institutions were regulated by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education."
"Existing law prohibits the use of any vacuum or suction dredge equipment by any person in any river, stream, or lake of this state without a permit issued by the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Existing law requires, before any person uses any vacuum or suction dredge equipment in any river, stream, or lake of this state, that person to submit an application for a permit for a vacuum or suction dredge to the department specifying certain information. Existing law requires the department to issue a permit, if the department determines that the use of a vacuum or suction dredge will not be deleterious to fish, upon the payment of a specified fee. Existing law designates the issuance of permits to operate vacuum or suction dredge equipment to be a project under the California Environmental Quality Act and suspends the issuance of permits and mining pursuant to a permit until the department has completed an environmental impact report for the project as ordered by the court in a specified court action. Existing law prohibits the use of any vacuum or suction dredge equipment in any river, stream, or lake of this state until the Director of Fish and Wildlife makes a prescribed certification to the Secretary of State, including certifying that new regulations fully mitigate all identified significant environmental impacts and that a fee structure is in place that will fully cover all costs to the department related to the administration of the program.
This bill would require the department to issue a permit if the department determines that the use does not cause any significant effects to fish and wildlife and would authorize the department to adjust the specified fee to an amount sufficient to cover all reasonable costs of the department in regulating suction dredging activities. This bill would prohibit the department from issuing a permit until the permit application is deemed complete, as prescribed. The bill would prohibit the permit from authorizing any activity in violation of other applicable requirements, conditions, or prohibitions governing the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment, and would require the department, the State Water Resources Control Board, and the regional water quality control boards to make reasonable efforts to share information among the agencies regarding potential violations of requirements, conditions, or prohibitions.
Under existing law, the State Water Resources Control Board and the California regional water quality control boards prescribe waste discharge requirements in accordance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (state act). The state act, with certain exceptions, requires a waste discharger to file certain information with the appropriate regional board and to pay an annual fee. The state act additionally requires a person, before discharging mining waste, to submit to the regional board a report on the physical and chemical characteristics of the waste that could affect its potential to cause pollution or contamination and a report that evaluates the potential of the mining waste discharge to produce acid mine drainage, the discharge or leaching of heavy metals, or the release of other hazardous substances.
This bill would, after prescribed public hearings and workshops, as specified, authorize the state board or a regional board to adopt waste discharge requirements or a waiver of waste discharge requirements that address water quality impacts of specified issues, specify certain conditions or areas where the discharge of waste or other adverse impacts on beneficial uses of the waters of the state from the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment is prohibited, or prohibit particular use of, or methods of using, vacuum or suction dredge equipment, or any portion thereof, for the extraction of minerals, as specified.
The bill would specify that the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment is defined as the use of a mechanized or motorized system for removing or assisting in the removal of, or the processing of, material from the bed, bank, or channel of a river, stream, or lake in order to recover minerals.","Declares that the people of California do enact regarding whether the use of vacuum or dredge equipment in a river, stream, or lake of this state is prohibited, except as authorized under a permit issued by the Department of Fish and Wildlife to that person by the Legislature in compliance with regulations adopted pursuant to the Fish and Game Code with respect to such use. Amends that Code, as amended by the California Water Resources Control Board Act of 1872, with respect to the use of vacuum or dredge equipment in a river, stream, or lake of this state."
"Existing law vests in the State Department of Developmental Services jurisdiction over state hospitals referred to as developmental centers for the provision of residential care to individuals with developmental disabilities. Existing law requires the department to comply with procedural requirements when closing a developmental center, including submitting a detailed plan to the Legislature and holding at least one public hearing. Under existing law, the department allocates funds to private nonprofit entities known as regional centers, which are required to provide, or arrange for the provision of, services and supports for persons with developmental disabilities.
This bill would require the department to submit a plan to the Legislature by April 1, 2016, to close the Sonoma Developmental Center and the Fairview Developmental Center. The bill would require the plan to meet existing requirements for closing a developmental center and to additionally include, specified components, including a closure plan that will result in each of the 2 developmental centers closing no later than December 31, 2018, except as specified. The bill would also require the plan to include a plan for using the properties occupied by the 2 developmental centers, as specified, and would require the department to work with the Department of General Services to estimate potential revenues that may be generated from different options for use of the properties.
The bill would state the intent of the Legislature that the department minimize the expenditure of state funds related to any developmental center residential units that are decertified for failure to meet federal or state health and safety laws or regulations or that receive notification from a state or federal regulator that they are at risk of decertification for failure to meet those laws or regulations, and that funds previously used to operate developmental centers instead be shifted to support community-based services for individuals with developmental disabilities.","Declares the intent of the Legislature that: (1) California recommits itself to vibrant and sustainable community services that will maximize opportunities for disabled individuals to thrive in their own neighborhoods; and (2) it is essential that California recommits itself to close additional developmental centers and shift the funds now being spent ineffectively for developmental center operations to shore up the community services system instead. Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to require the Department of Developmental Services to submit a plan to the Legislature by April 1, 2016, for the closure of the Sonoma and Lanterman Developmental Centers by December 31, 2019. Requires the plan to include: a closure plan that will provide a detailed rationale for closing the two centers no later than December 31, 2019; a plan for each of the two centers to facilitate shifting funds from developmental center operations to community services for individuals with developmental disabilities; and a plan for using the properties occupied by the two centers to estimate potential revenues that may be limited to different options for use of the properties."
"Existing law requires the Department of Human Resources to administer the Limited Examination and Appointment Program (LEAP) to provide an alternative to the traditional civil service examination and appointment process to facilitate the hiring of persons with disabilities in the state civil services. Existing law requires the department to conduct competitive examinations to determine eligibility for appointment under LEAP and to refer the names of eligible applicants who meet the minimum qualifications of a job classification to the appointing powers for examination appointments, as specified.
This bill would permit a person with a developmental disability to either complete a written examination or readiness evaluation or an internship, as specified, to qualify for service under LEAP. The bill would require that the use of an internship as a competitive examination in this context consist of a successful completion of an internship with a state agency of not less than 512 hours in duration and a specified certification by the agency. The bill would require the department to refer the names of eligible applicants who successfully complete the internship to the appointing powers for examination appointments. The bill would require the department to create that internship program in coordination with the State Department of Developmental Services and the Department of Rehabilitation, as specified. The bill would require a state agency that provides the internship or appoints a person with a developmental disability to a position under LEAP to allow that person to receive on-the-job support. The bill would authorize an agency to finance the internship or position with personnel funds or other available funds assigned to a vacant or unfilled position, as specified, but would provide that on-the-job support services are not the financial or programmatic responsibility of any state agency engaged in establishing the LEAP internship process. The bill would specify that LEAP is not a mandate on any state agency employer or job applicant except to the extent specifically directed by the State Personnel Board. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2021.","This bill requires the State Department of Developmental Services, consistent with board rules, to be responsible for the administration of the Limited Examination and Appointment Program. This program shall provide an alternative to the traditional civil service examination and appointment process to facilitate the hiring of persons with disabilities in the state civil service."
"Existing law, the After School Education and Safety Program Act of 2002, enacted by initiative statute, establishes the After School Education and Safety Program to serve pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 9, inclusive, at participating public elementary, middle, junior high, and charter schools. The act provides that each school establishing a program pursuant to the act is eligible to receive a renewable 3-year grant for before or after school programs, as provided, and a grant for operating a program beyond 180 regular schooldays or during summer, weekend, intersession, or vacation periods, as provided. The act specifies the maximum grant amount and related amounts for each of these grants, provides a formula for determining an amount to be continuously appropriated from the General Fund to the State Department of Education for purposes of the program, and authorizes the Legislature to appropriate additional funds for purposes of the program.
Existing law requires applicants for grants to, among other things, state the targeted number of pupils to be served by the program, and requires the department, for any school in the program that is under its targeted attendance level by more than 15% in each of 2 consecutive years, to adjust the grant level, and, in any year after the initial grant year, if a school’s actual attendance level falls below 75% of the targeted attendance level, to review the program and adjust its grant level as appropriate.
This bill would, commencing January 1, 2016, and until July 1, 2017, authorize a program to suspend its operation for up to 5 schooldays in a fiscal year
and, if this results in
and would prohibit
an adjustment of the grant provided to the participating
school, would authorize the department to approve a request from the program grantee for an exemption from this adjustment.
school as a result of a suspension.
The bill would require that cost savings that result from a suspension be used solely by the entity that is providing direct services to pupils. The bill would also authorize the program to determine the specific grades to serve in accordance with local needs.
Existing law expresses the intent of the Legislature that, for the before and after school components of the program, participating middle school and junior high school pupils should attend a minimum number of hours, days, or both, as specified, while elementary school pupils should participate in the full day of these components of the program for each day in which they participate, except as provided.
This bill would instead express the intent of the Legislature that each attending pupil participate in the full day of the before or after school components of the program for each day in which the pupil attends the program, except as provided.
The After School Education and Safety Program Act of 2002 authorizes the Legislature to amend certain of its provisions to further its purposes by majority vote of each house.
This bill would set forth a legislative finding and declaration that this bill furthers the purposes of that act.","This bill amends the Education Code, with respect to before and after school programs, to require that the after-school programs be established at participating public elementary, middle, junior high, and charter schools for pupils in kindergarten through grade nine. Under current law, such programs are only required to serve pupils in kindergarten through grade nine. The after-school programs must consist of both: (1) educational and literacy elements in which tutoring or homework assistance is provided in language arts, mathematics, history and social science, computer training, or science; and (2) educational enrichment elements that may include, but need not be limited to, fine arts, career technical education, recreation, physical fitness, and prevention activities. The majority of the time spent by a pupil who is in kindergarten or any of grades one to nine shall be at a site that complies with this Act. Applicants shall agree that snacks made available through a program shall conform to federal nutrition standards and that meals made available through such a program shall conform to the nutrition standards of the Department of Agriculture's Child and Adult Food Program."
"Existing law generally prohibits the total gross weight in pounds imposed on the highway by a group of 2 or more consecutive axles of a vehicle from exceeding a specified weight, depending on the distance in feet between the extremes of a group of 2 or more consecutive axles, and the number of axles.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.","Amends the Vehicle Code to reduce the total gross weight in pounds imposed on California highways by any group of two or more consecutive axles to specified amounts for specified distances from the extremes of: (1) distance in feet between the extremes of any group of two or more consecutive axles 2 axles 3 axles 4 axles 6 axles; (2) distance in feet between the extremes of any group of two or more consecutive axles 8 axles; (9) distance in feet between the extremes of any group of two or more consecutive axles 10 axles; and (11) distance in feet between the extremes of any group of two or more consecutive axles 12 axles. Allows, with certain exceptions, two consecutive sets of tandem axles to carry a gross weight of 34,000 pounds each if the overall distance between the first and last axles of the consecutive sets of tandem axles is 36 feet or more."
"Existing law provides that a minor who violates a criminal law may be adjudged to be a ward of the court. Existing law generally requires that the minor pay a restitution fine to be deposited into the Restitution Fund and restitution to any victim of his or her conduct. Existing law defines a victim to include the immediate surviving family of the actual victim and governmental entities, as specified.
This bill would expand the definition of victim to include a corporation, estate, or other legal or commercial entity when that entity is a direct victim of a crime. The bill would also expand the definition of victim to include a person who has sustained economic loss as a result of a crime and who satisfies specified conditions.",Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to require a court to consider imposing a restitution fine upon the minor who incurs an economic loss as a result of committing one or more felony offenses or misdemeanor offenses. Directs that such fine be deposited into the Restitution Fund.
"(1) Existing law requires the lessor of a building intended for human occupation to repair dilapidations, as specified, rendering it untenantable. Existing law permits tenants to repair dilapidations, under specified circumstances.
This bill would provide that a lessor is not obligated to repair a dilapidation relating to mold, as specified, until he or she has notice of it or if the tenant is in violation of specified affirmative obligations. The bill would authorize a landlord to enter a dwelling to repair a dilapidation relating to mold, under specified conditions.
(2) The State Housing Law, which is administered by the Department of Housing and Community Development, prescribes standards for buildings used for human habitation and establishes definitions for this purpose. The law provides that a building, or a portion of it, in which certain conditions are found to exist, such as a lack of sanitation, as specified, is substandard. The law provides that a violation of these provisions is a misdemeanor.
This bill would specify that visible mold growth, excepting mold that is minor and found on surfaces that can accumulate moisture as part of their proper and intended use, is a type of inadequate sanitation and therefore a substandard condition. The bill would define mold as microscopic organisms or fungi that can grow in damp conditions in the interior of a building. By expanding the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 14, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)Amends the Health and Safety Code (the Code) to declare that an obligation shall not arise under specified provisions of such Code to repair a dilapidation relating to the presence of mold until the lessor has notice of the dilapidation or if the tenant is in violation of such provisions. Permits: (1) a landlord to enter a dwelling unit to repair a dilapidation relating to the presence of mold pursuant to such provisions provided the landlord complies with provisions of the Code concerning fire protection and prevention services; and (2) an approved testing or listing agency to report annually on the production of listed products, equipment, and installations tested by an approved testing agency and that maintains a periodic inspection program on current production of listed products, equipment, and installations, and that, at least annually, makes available a published report on all conditions tested by this code as determined by a health officer or a code enforcement officer.Deems as a substandard building: (1) certain conditions relating to the presence of mold; and (2) failure to comply with certain building standards, including adequate heating, ventilation, and electrical lighting."
"Existing law defines specified terms for purposes of the California Residential Mortgage Lending Act, which generally prohibits a person from engaging in the business of making residential mortgage loans or servicing residential mortgage loans without first obtaining a license from the Commissioner of Business Oversight in accordance with the act. Existing law defines a lender as a person who is an approved lender for the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Administration, the Farmers Home Administration, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, who directly makes residential mortgage loans, and who makes the credit decision in the loan transactions. Existing law requires a licensee issued a license for purposes of making or servicing residential mortgage loans to continuously maintain a minimum tangible net worth of $250,000.
This bill would specify that the term “lender” includes a person, other than a natural person, and a natural person who is also an independent contractor, who engages in the activities of a loan processor or underwriter for residential mortgage loans, but does not solicit loan applicants, originate mortgage loans, or fund mortgage loans, as specified. The bill would authorize the commissioner to require a licensee who is engaged in the processing or underwriting of residential mortgage loans to continuously maintain a minimum tangible net worth in an amount that is greater than $250,000, but that does not exceed the net worth required of an approved lender under the Federal Housing Administration.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Financial Code of 1934 to declare that a person shall not be deemed to control a financial institution solely by reason of his or her status as an officer, director, or licensee of the institution.

"Existing law exempts from civil liability any person who, in good faith and not for compensation, renders emergency care or treatment by the use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) at the scene of an emergency, except in the case of personal injury or wrongful death that results from the gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct of the person who renders emergency care or treatment. Existing law also exempts from civil liability a person or entity that acquires an AED for emergency use, a physician who is involved with the placement of the AED, and any person or entity responsible for the site where the AED is located if specified conditions are met, including maintenance and regular testing of the AED and having a written plan that describes the procedures to be followed in case of an emergency that may involve the use of the AED. Under existing law, those specified conditions also require, when an AED is placed in a public or private K–12 school, the school principal to, among other things, ensure that the school administrators and staff annually receive a brochure, approved as to content and style by the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross, that describes the proper use of an AED, to ensure that similar information is posted next to every AED, and to designate the trained employees who are available to respond to an emergency that may involve the use of an AED during normal operating hours.
This bill would provide an exemption from civil liability for a physician and surgeon or other health care professional that is involved in the selection, placement, or installation of an AED. The bill would require a person or entity, other than a health facility as defined, that acquires an AED to, among other things, comply with specified regulations for the placement of the device and ensure that the AED is maintained and tested as specified. The bill would require a building owner to annually notify the tenants as to the location of the AED units and provide information to tenants about who they can contact if they want to voluntarily take AED or CPR training, to offer a demonstration to at least one person associated with the building as to the use of an AED in an emergency, and post instructions for the use of the AED. The bill would also specify that a medical director or physician and surgeon is not required to be involved in the acquisition or placement of an AED. The bill would make related changes.
This bill would revise the public or private K–12 school provisions described above by instead requiring, when an AED is placed in a public or private K–12 school, the school principal to ensure that the school administrators and staff annually receive information that describes sudden cardiac arrest, the school’s emergency response plan, and the proper use of an AED, by instead requiring the school principal to ensure that instructions, in no less than 14-point type, on how to use the AED are posted next to every AED, and by deleting the requirement that the school principal designate the trained employees who are available to respond to an emergency that may involve the use of an AED during normal operating hours.","(Sec. 2) Requires a person or entity that acquires an automated external defibrillator (AED) to: (1) comply with all regulations governing the placement of an AED; (2) notify an agent of the local EMS agency of the existence, location, and type of an AED acquired; (3) ensure that the AED is maintained and tested according to the operation and maintenance guidelines set forth by the manufacturer; (4) ensure that an inspection is made of all AEDs on the premises at least every 90 days for potential issues related to operability of the device, including a blinking light or other obvious defect that may suggest tampering or that another problem has arisen with its functionality; and (5) ensure that records of AED maintenance and testing are maintained. Directs a building owner, when an AED is placed in a building, to: (1) notify the tenants as to the location of AED units and provide information to them about who they can contact if they want to voluntarily take AED or CPR training; (2) notify school employees as to the location of all AED units on the campus; and (3) post instructions, in no less than 14-point type, on how to use an AED.

The bill would authorize the department to enter into an agreement with an academic institution or other entity with sufficient expertise for the purpose of creating, performing, or both creating and performing the evaluation. The bill would authorize an organization receiving a grant to utilize the funds in any reasonable manner, as long as the funds are expended in furtherance of the organization’s program or other requirements established by the department.
The bill would require organizations receiving grant funding to contact the county welfare department upon being notified of the grant and to make a good faith effort to coordinate their programs with CalWORKs requirements.

law, the State Civil Service Act,
establishes standards for the use of personal services contracts by state agencies.
Existing law
The act
provides that personal services contracting is permissible to achieve cost savings when certain conditions are met, including, but not limited to, that the contracting agency demonstrates that the proposed contract will result in actual overall cost savings to the state and that the contract will not cause the displacement of civil service employees.
The act also
authorizes state agencies to enter into personal services contracts for functions exempted from civil service. The California Constitution excludes the officers and employees of the California State University from the state civil service.
This bill would make these provisions for the use of personal services contracts applicable to California State Universities.
Existing law authorizes the trustees of the California State University to enter into agreements with any public or private agency, person, or institution for the furnishing of services, facilities, goods, supplies, or equipment, among others, and requires the trustees to prescribe policies and procedures for the acquisition of those services, facilities, materials, goods, supplies, or equipment.
This bill would establish standards for the use of personal services contracts by the trustees of the California State University similar to those in the State Civil Service Act.","Amends the Education Code to establish standards for the use of personal services contracts by the trustees of the California State University. <n>Authorizes the trustees to enter into personal services contracts to achieve cost savings when specified conditions are met, including that: (1) the trustees clearly demonstrate that the proposed contract will result in actual overall cost savings to the California State University; (2) proposals to contract out work shall not be approved solely on the basis that savings will result from lower contractor pay rates or benefits; (3) the contract does not cause the displacement of university employees; (4) the contract is with a firm; (5) the contract does not adversely affect the university's affirmative action efforts; (6) the amount of savings shall be large enough to ensure that they will not be eliminated by private sector and university cost fluctuations that could normally be expected during the contracting period; (7) the contract is awarded through a publicized, competitive bidding process; (8) the potential for future economic risk to the university from potential contractor rate increases is minimal; and (9) the contract is with a firm. <n>Permits the trustees to enter into such contracts when specified conditions are met, including that: (1) the contract is for a new university function and the Legislature has specifically mandated or authorized the performance of the work by independent contractors; (2) the"
"The Pharmacy Law governs the practice of pharmacy in this state, including the permissible duties of licensed pharmacists. The Pharmacy Law authorizes a pharmacist filling a prescription order for a drug product prescribed by its trade or brand name to select another drug product with the same active chemical ingredients of the same strength, quantity, and dosage form, and of the same generic drug name as determined, as specified, of those drug products having the same active chemical ingredients. A knowing violation of the Pharmacy Law is a misdemeanor.
This bill, except as specified, would authorize a pharmacist to select an alternative biological product when filling a prescription order for a prescribed biological product if the alternative biological product is interchangeable, as defined, and the prescriber does not personally indicate in a prescribed manner that a substitution is not to be made. The bill would require a pharmacist or a designee, within a specified period following the dispensing of a biological product, to make an electronically accessible entry in a described entry system of the specific biological product provided to the patient. The bill would provide an alternate means of communicating the name of the biological product dispensed to the prescriber if the pharmacy does not have access to one or more of the described entry systems. The bill would also require that the substitution of a biological product be communicated to the patient. The bill would prohibit a pharmacist from selecting an alternative biological product that meets the requirements of these provisions unless the cost to the patient of the alternative biological product selected is the same or less than the cost of the prescribed biological product. Because a knowing violation of these requirements would be a misdemeanor, the bill would create new crimes, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
The bill would also require the California State Board of Pharmacy to maintain on its public Internet Web site a link to the current list, if available, of biological products determined by the federal Food and Drug Administration to be interchangeable.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on December 20, 2010. The summary of that version is repeated here.)<n><n>Amends the Business and Professions Code of California to allow a pharmacist filling a prescription for a prescribed biological product to select an alternative biological product only if all of the following is interoperable with the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA): (1) the prescriber does not substitute or words of similar meaning in the prescription as transmitted by electronic data; (2) there is no interchangeable biological product approved by the FDA for the product prescribed; and (3) a prescription is not changed from the product dispensed on the prior filling of the prescription.<n><n>Requires a dispensing pharmacist or the pharmacist's designee to make an entry of the specific biological product provided to the patient, including the name of the biological product and the manufacturer, through an electronic medical records system, an electronic prescribing technology, a pharmacy benefit management system, or another electronic records system presumed to provide notice to the prescriber.<n><n>Presumes to provide such notice that entry into such systems shall be conveyed by making an entry that can be electronically accessed by the prescriber through one or more of the following electronic records systems: (1) an electronic medical records system; (2) an electronic prescribing technology;"

Existing law requires hospitals, among other things, to have a written discharge planning policy and process that requires appropriate arrangements to be made for posthospital care. A violation of those provisions is a crime.
This bill would require a hospital to take specified actions relating to family caregivers, including, among others, notifying the family caregiver of the patient’s discharge or transfer to another facility and providing information and counseling regarding the posthospital care needs of the patient, if the patient has consented to the disclosure of this information. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Requires each hospital to: (1) have a written discharge planning policy and process; (2) provide each inpatient patient with an opportunity to identify one family caregiver who may assist in posthospital care; (3) provide the patient or patient's legal guardian with an opportunity to designate a caregiver at the discretion of the attending physician, following discharge or recovery of consciousness or capacity; and (4) provide the patient or patient's legal guardian with an opportunity to designate a caregiver at the discretion of the attending physician, following discharge or recovery of consciousness or capacity. Requires the policy to require that the patient's designated family caregiver be notified of the patients discharge or transfer to another facility as soon as possible and, in any event, upon issuance of a discharge order by the patients attending physician. Provides that the lack of contact shall not interfere with, delay, or otherwise affect the medical care provided to the patient or an appropriate discharge of the patient. Makes the right to information regarding continuing health care requirements following discharge applicable to the person who has legal responsibility to make decisions regarding medical care on behalf of the patient, if the patient is unable to make such decisions. Directs the hospital to provide an opportunity for the patient and his or her designated family caregiver to engage in the discharge planning process."
"Existing law provides that a person who photographs or records by any means the image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person, under circumstances where the parties agree or understand that the image shall remain private, and the person subsequently distributes the image taken, with the intent to cause serious emotional distress, and the depicted person suffers serious emotional distress, is guilty of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor.
Under existing law, matter that depicts a person under 18 years of age personally engaging in or personally simulating sexual conduct, as defined, and that is in the possession of any city, county, city and county, or state official or agency is subject to forfeiture pursuant to a petition for forfeiture brought in the county in which the matter is located. Existing law provides for forfeiture by a defendant of illegal telecommunications equipment, or a computer, computer system, or computer network, and any software or data that was used in committing specified crimes, including depiction of a person under 18 years of age personally engaging in or personally simulating sexual conduct.
This bill would make the forfeiture provisions described above applicable to illegal telecommunications equipment, or a computer, computer system, or computer network, and any software or data, when used in committing a violation of disorderly conduct related to invasion of privacy, as specified. The bill would also establish forfeiture proceedings for matter obtained through disorderly conduct by invasion of privacy, as specified.","Amends the State of California criminal code to allow a sentencing court, upon petition by the prosecuting attorney, at any time following sentencing, or by agreement of all parties, to conduct a hearing to determine whether any property or property interest is subject to forfeiture. Includes within the definition of ""property subject to forfeiture"" any property of the defendant that is illegal telecommunications equipment, a computer, computer system, or computer network, and any software or data residing thereon, if such equipment, system, or network was used in committing a violation of specified unlawful activity. Excludes from the definition any property used solely in the commission of an infraction. Provides that forfeiture shall not be available for any property used solely in the commission of an infraction and, if the defendant is a minor, includes property of the parent or guardian of the defendant."
"The Trial Court Employment Protection and Governance Act establishes a trial court employee personnel system that provides authority to hire trial court personnel, regulates the classification and compensation of trial court employees, labor relations, and personnel files, and requires each trial court to establish a system of employment selection and advancement and an employment protection system.
Existing law authorizes state agencies to use personal services contracts to achieve cost savings if specified standards are satisfied, including, among other things, the contract does not cause the displacement of civil service employees and the contract is awarded through a publicized, competitive bidding process. The State Personnel Board is required to review a proposed contract upon the request of an employee organization for compliance with those standards.
This bill would establish specified standards if a trial court intends to enter into a contract for any services that are currently or customarily performed by that trial court’s employees. Among other things, the bill would require the trial court to clearly demonstrate that the proposed contract will result in actual overall cost savings to the trial court. The bill would provide that those standards do not apply to a contract under certain circumstances, including, among others, when the services are incidental to a contract for the purchase or lease of real or personal property.
This bill would provide that its provisions are severable.","(Sec. 1) Prohibits contracts for services that are currently or have been customarily performed by the trial court employees from being permissible to achieve cost savings in that trial court when all of the following conditions are met: the trial court clearly demonstrates that the proposed contract will result in actual overall cost savings to the trial court; proposals to contract out work shall not be approved solely on the basis that savings will result from lower contractor pay rates or benefits; contracts shall be eligible for approval if a clear need for independent wages is at the industrys level and do not significantly undercut trial court pay rates; the contract does not cause the displacement of trial court employees; the contract is with a firm; the potential economic advantage is minimal; the contractor will conduct training courses for which appropriately qualified trial court employees are not available from the court, provided that the potential economic advantage is not outweighed by the public health, welfare, or safety; the legislative, administrative, or legal goals of the Legislature have specifically mandated or authorized the performance of the work by independent contractors; the contract is between a trial court and another trial court or government entity for services to be performed by trial court employees, is for a new trial court function and is for services to be performed by independent contractors; the services to perform"
"The Corporation Tax Law imposes taxes according to or measured by net income at a rate of 8.84%, or for financial institutions, at a rate of 10.84%, as specified.
This bill would, for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2015, revise that rate for taxpayers that are publicly held corporations, as defined, and instead impose an applicable tax rate from 7% to 13%, or for financial institutions, from 9% to 15%, based on the compensation ratio, as defined, of the corporation. This bill would increase the applicable tax rate by 50% for those taxpayers that have a specified decrease in full-time employees employed in the United States as compared to an increase in contracted and foreign full-time employees, as described.
This bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIII A of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of
2/3
of the membership of each house of the Legislature.
This act provides for a tax levy within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect.","Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to reduce the corporate income tax rate for corporations doing business within the State of California by specified amounts for calendar or fiscal years ending after June 30, 1973, for calendar or fiscal years ending in 1980 to 1986, for calendar or fiscal years ending in 1987 to 1996, and for any income year beginning before January 1, 1997. Reduces such tax rate by specified amounts for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015."
"The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 establishes the State Air Resources Board as the state agency responsible for monitoring and regulating sources emitting greenhouse gases. The act requires the state board to adopt regulations to require the reporting and verification of statewide greenhouse gas emissions and to monitor and enforce compliance with this program. The act requires the state board to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit, as defined, to be achieved by 2020, equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990. The state board is required to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective greenhouse gas emission reductions. The act authorizes the state board to adopt market-based compliance mechanisms, as defined, meeting specified requirements. Existing law requires the state board to complete a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, as defined, in the state.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including gas corporations. Existing law requires the commission to adopt policies and programs that promote the in-state production and distribution of biomethane, as defined, that facilitate the development of a variety of sources of in-state biomethane. Existing law requires the commission to adopt pipeline access rules that ensure that each gas corporation provides nondiscriminatory open access to its gas pipeline system to any party for the purposes of physically interconnecting with the gas pipeline system and effectuating the delivery of gas.
The Warren-Alquist State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Act establishes the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission and requires it to prepare an integrated energy policy report on or before November 1, 2003, and every 2 years thereafter. The act requires the report to contain an overview of major energy trends and issues facing the state, including, but not limited to, supply, demand, pricing, reliability, efficiency, and impacts on public health and safety, the economy, resources, and the environment. Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to hold public hearings to identify impediments that limit procurement of biomethane in California, including, but not limited to, impediments to interconnection and to offer solutions to those impediments as part of the integrated energy policy report.
This bill would require the state board, on or before June 30,
2016,
2017,
in consultation with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission and the Public Utilities Commission, to adopt a carbon-based renewable gas standard, as defined and specified, that requires all gas sellers, as defined, to provide specified percentages of renewable gas meeting certain deliverability requirements, to retail end-use customers for use in California, that increases over specified compliance periods. The bill would authorize the state board to waive enforcement of the renewable gas standard upon certain showings being made by a gas seller. The bill would require the state board, on or before January 1, 2017, to issue an analysis of the lifecycle emissions of greenhouse gases and reductions for different biogas types and end uses.
The bill would require the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to provide the state board and the Legislature with an assessment of specified matter pertaining to renewable gas by January 1, 2018.",Adds to the list of purposes of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the production of renewable gas from: (1) organic waste or other organic materials; (2) biogas generated from organic waste or other organic materials; (3) landfill gas; and (4) wastewater and synthetic natural gas generated from organic waste and biosolids.
"(1) The California Constitution generally limits ad valorem taxes on real property to 1% of the full cash value, as defined, of that property, and provides that the full cash value base may be adjusted each year by the inflationary rate not to exceed 2% for any given year.
Existing property tax law implementing this constitutional authority provides that the taxable value of real property is the lesser of its base year value compounded annually by an inflation factor not to exceed 2%, as provided, or its full cash value. Existing property tax law also provides that the taxable value of a manufactured home is the lesser of its base year value compounded annually by an inflation factor not to exceed 2% or its full cash value.
This bill, for any assessment year commencing on or after January 1, 2017, would provide that the inflation factor shall not apply to the principal place of residence, including a manufactured home, of a qualified veteran, as defined, who is 65 years of age or older on the lien date, was honorably discharged from military service, and meets specified requirements.
By changing the manner in which local tax officials calculate the taxable value of real property owned by senior veterans, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing property tax law provides, pursuant to the authorization of the California Constitution, a disabled veteran’s property tax exemption for the principal place of residence of a veteran or a veteran’s spouse, including an unmarried surviving spouse, if the veteran, because of injury incurred in military service, is blind in both eyes, has lost the use of 2 or more limbs, or is totally disabled, as those terms are defined, or if the veteran has, as a result of a service-connected injury or disease, died while on active duty in military service. Existing law exempts that part of the full value of the residence that does not exceed $100,000, or $150,000, if the veteran’s or spouse’s household income does not exceed $40,000, adjusted for inflation, as specified.
This bill, for property tax lien dates on an after January 1, 2017, would instead exempt the full value of the principal place of residence of a veteran or veteran’s spouse if the veteran’s or spouse’s household income does not exceed $40,000, adjusted for inflation. The bill would also make technical and conforming changes to the disabled veteran’s property tax exemption.
By changing the manner in which local tax officials administer the disabled veteran’s property tax exemption, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.
This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
(5) This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","This bill amends the Revenue and Taxation Code, with respect to the tax treatment of real property in California, to provide that the taxable value of real property shall be the lesser of: (1) its base year value compounded annually since the base year by an inflation factor; or (2) the percentage change in the cost of living, as determined by the California Department of Industrial Relations. The percentage increase for an assessment year commencing before January 1, 1985, shall be not exceed two percent of the prior year's value. The percentage increase for any assessment year commencing on or after January 1, 2017, shall be the percentage change, rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of one percent, from December of the prior fiscal year to December of the current fiscal year in the California Consumer Price Index for all items. This bill shall not apply to the principal place of residence of a qualified veteran who is 65 years of age or older on the lien date and was honorably discharged from military service. The claimant shall provide all information required by, and answer all questions contained in, an affidavit furnished by the assessor to determine that the claimant is a qualified veteran."
"Under existing law, the Emergency Medical Services System and the Prehospital Emergency Medical Care Personnel Act, the Emergency Medical Services Authority is responsible for establishing minimum standards and promulgating regulations for the training and scope of practice for emergency medical technician-paramedic (EMT-P).

Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) fees for services that are not limited to all applicants; (2) competency testing; (3) fingerprint images and related information for criminal offender record searches; (4) verification of continuing education for a lapse in licensure; and (5) replacement of a lost licensure card."
"Existing law authorizes state agencies to enter into contracts for the acquisition of goods or services upon approval by the Department of General Services. Existing law sets forth various requirements and prohibitions for those contracts, including, but not limited to, a prohibition on entering into contracts for the acquisition of goods or services of $100,000 or more with a contractor that discriminates between spouses and domestic partners or same-sex and different-sex couples in the provision of benefits. Existing law provides that a contract entered into in violation of those requirements and prohibitions is void and authorizes the state or any person acting on behalf of the state to bring a civil action seeking a determination that a contract is in violation and therefore void. Under existing law, a willful violation of those requirements and prohibitions is a misdemeanor.
This bill would also prohibit a state agency from entering into contracts for the acquisition of goods or services of $100,000 or more with a contractor that discriminates between employees on the basis of gender identity in the provision of benefits, as specified. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Public Contract Code to prohibit a state agency from entering into any contract with a contractor for the acquisition of goods or services in the amount of one million dollars or more with a contractor that discriminates between employees on the basis of actual or perceived gender identity, including, but not limited to, employee identification as transgender."
"Existing law prohibits Members of the Legislature, state, county, district, judicial district, and city officers or employees from being financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity, or by any body or board of which they are members. Existing law identifies certain remote interests in contracts that are not subject to this prohibition and other situations in which an official is not deemed to be financially interested in a contract. Existing law makes a willful violation of this prohibition a crime.
This bill would include in the definition of “remote interest” the interest of a person who is an owner or partner of a firm serving as an appointed member of an unelected board or commission of the contracting agency, if the owner or partner recuses himself or herself from providing any advice to the contracting agency regarding the contract between the firm and the contracting agency, and from all participation in reviewing a project that results from that contract. The bill would also include in the definition of “remote interest” the interest of a planner employed by a consulting engineering, architectural, or planning firm.","Prohibits State and local government officers from being deemed to be interested in contracts entered into by body or board of which they are members if the officer has only a remote interest and if that interest is disclosed to such body or board, and thereafter the body or board authorizes, approves, or ratifies the contract in good faith by a vote of its membership sufficient for the purpose without counting the vote or votes of the officer or member with the remote interest. Defines, for purposes of this Act, the term ""remote interest"" to mean: (1) that of an officer or employee of a nonprofit entity or a nonprofit corporation; (2) that of an employee or agent of the contracting party if the contracting party has ten or more other employees and if the officer was an employee or agent of that contracting party for at least three years prior to accepting his or her office and the officer owns less than three percent of the stock of the contracting party; and (3) that of an employee or agent of the contracting party if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the agency of which the person is an officer is a local public agency located in a county with a population of less than 4 million; (2) the contract is competitively bid and is not for personal services; (3) the employee or agent"
"Existing law, the Gun-Free School Zone Act of 1995, subject to exceptions, prohibits a person from possessing a firearm in a place that the person knows, or reasonably should know, is a school zone, unless with the written permission of certain school district officials. Existing law defines a school zone as an area on the grounds of a school providing instruction in kindergarten or grades 1 to 12, inclusive, or within a distance of 1,000 feet of that school. Existing law prohibits a person from bringing or possessing a firearm upon the grounds of a campus of a public or private university or college, or buildings owned or operated for student housing, teaching, research, or administration by a public or private university or college, that are contiguous or are clearly marked university property, as specified, unless with the written permission of specified university or college officials. Under existing law, a violation of these provisions is a felony, or, under specified circumstances, a misdemeanor. Under existing law, certain persons are exempt from both the school zone and the university prohibitions, including, among others, a person holding a valid license to carry a concealed firearm and a retired peace officer authorized to carry a concealed or loaded firearm.
This bill would recast the provisions relating to a person holding a valid license to carry a concealed firearm to allow that person to carry a firearm in an area that is within 1,000 feet of, but not on the grounds of, a public or private school providing instruction in kindergarten or grades 1 to 12, inclusive. The bill would also delete the exemption that allows a person holding a valid license to carry a concealed firearm to bring or possess a firearm on the campus of a university or college. The bill would create an additional exemption from those prohibitions for certain appointed peace officers who are authorized to carry a firearm by their appointing agency, and an exemption for certain retired reserve peace officers who are authorized to carry a concealed or loaded firearm. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.
Existing law, subject to exceptions, prohibits carrying ammunition or reloaded ammunition onto school grounds unless it is with the written permission of the school district superintendent, the superintendent’s designee, or equivalent school authority.
This bill would reorganize those exceptions. The bill would delete the exemption that allows a person to carry ammunition or reloaded ammunition onto school grounds if the person is licensed to carry a concealed firearm. The bill would also create an additional exception to that prohibition by authorizing a person to carry ammunition or reloaded ammunition onto school grounds if it is in a motor vehicle at all times and is within a locked container or within the locked trunk of the vehicle.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Gun-Free School Zone Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit any person from possessing a firearm in a place that the person knows, or reasonably should know, is a school zone, unless it is with the written permission of the school district superintendent, his or her designee, or equivalent school authority, and such prohibition does not apply: (1) within a place of residence or place of business or on private property, if such place is not part of the school grounds and the possession of the firearm is otherwise lawful; (2) when the firearm is an unloaded pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on the person and is in a locked container or within the locked trunk of a motor vehicle; (3) when the person possessing the firearm reasonably believes that he or she is in grave danger because of circumstances forming the basis of a current restraining order issued by a court against another person or persons who has been found to pose a threat to his or her life or safety; and (4) when the person is exempt from the prohibition against carrying a concealed firearm pursuant to specified Federal provisions, when the person holds a valid license to carry the firearm, who is carrying the firearm in an area that is not in, or on the grounds of, a public or private school providing"
"(1) Existing law requires each school district and county superintendent of schools maintaining kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, to provide for each needy pupil one nutritionally adequate, free or reduced-price meal during each schoolday. Existing law requires the governing board of a school district and the county superintendent of schools to make applications for free or reduced-price meals available to pupils at all times during each regular schoolday. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to supervise the implementation of this program and to investigate acts of alleged noncompliance.
This bill would authorize the governing boards of school districts and county superintendents of schools to also make applications for free or reduced-price meals electronically available online. The bill would specify requirements that would have to be met by the governing boards of school districts, county offices of education, and school food authorities who choose to provide access to an online application under this bill.
The bill would require all applications to include clear instructions for families that are homeless or are migrants. To the extent that this provision would impose new duties on local educational agencies, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003.

"Existing federal law authorizes any authorized immigration officer to issue an immigration detainer that serves to advise another law enforcement agency that the federal department seeks custody of an alien presently in the custody of that agency, for the purpose of arresting and removing the alien. Existing federal law provides that the detainer is a request that the agency advise the department, prior to release of the alien, in order for the department to arrange to assume custody in situations when gaining immediate physical custody is either impracticable or impossible.

Existing law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, regulates the packaging, labeling, and advertising of drugs and devices and is administered by the State Department of Public Health. A violation of that law is a crime. The Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law prohibits, among other things, the sale, delivery, or giving away of a new drug or new device unless either the department has approved a new drug or device application for that new drug or new device and that approval has not been withdrawn, terminated, or suspended or the drug or device has been approved pursuant to specified provisions of federal law, including the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
The Medical Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians and surgeons by the Medical Board of California and requires the board to take action against a licensee who is charged with unprofessional conduct. The Osteopathic Act provides for the licensure and regulation of osteopathic physicians and surgeons by the Osteopathic Medical Board of California and requires the board to enforce the Medical Practice Act with respect to its licensees.

Existing law requires the terms of probation or parole for all persons placed on formal probation or parole for an offense that requires registration as a sex offender to include, among other things, participation in, or completion of, a sex offender management program, as specified.
This bill would make it a felony for a person to willfully remove or disable an electronic, global positioning system, or other monitoring device, if the device was affixed as a condition of parole, postrelease community supervision, or probation as a result of a conviction of certain specified sex offenses, if the person intended to evade supervision and either does not surrender, or is not apprehended, within one week of the issuance of a warrant for absconding, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months, or 2 or 3 years.

"Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations, as defined. The Public Utilities Act imposes various duties and responsibilities on the commission with respect to the purchase of electricity and requires the commission to review and adopt a procurement plan and a renewable energy procurement plan for each electrical corporation pursuant to the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program (RPS program). The RPS program requires the commission to establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring all retail sellers, as defined, to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, at specified percentages of the total kilowatthours sold to their retail end-customers during specified compliance periods. Existing law authorizes the commission to require a retail seller to procure eligible renewable energy resources in excess of the specified quantities.

"Existing law provides that a minor may be adjudged a dependent child of the juvenile court under specified circumstances. Existing law authorizes the court to place a minor who has been removed from the custody of his or her parent or guardian in foster care, among other placements. Existing law extends certain foster care benefits to youth up to 21 years of age, known as nonminor dependents if specified conditions are met.
Under existing law, a county social worker develops a case plan for a minor or nonminor dependent that, among other things, identifies specific goals and the appropriateness of the planned services in meeting those goals. Existing law requires, if out-of-home placement is used to attain case plan goals, the case plan to include a description of the type of home or institution in which the child is to be placed, and the reasons for that placement decision. Existing law also specifies certain factors that must be considered in making a placement decision.
This bill would require children and nonminor dependents in an out-of-home placement to be placed according to their gender identity, regardless of the gender or sex listed in their court or child welfare records. By expanding the duties of counties relating to the placement of foster children and nonminor dependents, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law provides that it is the policy of the state that all minors and nonminors in foster care have specified rights, including, among others, the right to have fair and equal access to all available services, placement, care, treatment, and benefits, and to not be subjected to discrimination or harassment on the basis of actual or perceived race, ethnic group identification, ancestry, national origin, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental or physical disability, or HIV status.
This bill would additionally specify that all minors and nonminors in foster care have the right to be placed in out-of-home care according to their gender identity, regardless of the gender or sex listed in their court or child welfare records. The bill would require the State Department of Social Services to adopt regulations consistent with this provision.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.
The Jobs and Economic Improvement Through Environmental Leadership Act of 2011 authorizes the Governor, until January 1, 2016, to certify projects meeting certain requirements, including the requirement that the project creates high-wage, highly skilled jobs that pay prevailing wages and living wages, for streamlining benefits provided by that act. The act provides that if a lead agency fails to approve a project certified by the Governor before January 1, 2017, then the certification expires and is no longer valid. The act requires a lead agency to prepare the record of proceedings for the certified project concurrent with the preparation of the environmental documents. The act is repealed by its own terms on January 1, 2017.
This bill would extend the authority of the Governor to certify a project to January 1, 2018. The bill would provide that the certification expires and is no longer valid if the lead agency fails to approve a certified project before January 1, 2019. If a project is certified by the Governor, the bill would require contractors and subcontractors to pay to all construction workers employed in the execution of the project at least the general prevailing rate of per diem wages and would provide for the enforcement of this requirement. The bill would repeal the act on January 1, 2019. Because the bill would extend the obligation of the lead agency to prepare concurrently the record of proceedings, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would, notwithstanding any other law, require a multifamily residential project certified pursuant to the act to provide private vehicle parking spaces that are priced and rented or purchased separately from dwelling units, except as provided.

The bill would authorize the board to award grants to assist counties with the creation or expansion of infrastructure that allows each county to consistently collect and report specified criminal justice information. The bill would require each local community corrections partnership, on or before June 1, 2015, to report to the board on the county’s capacity to collect and report the data required. The bill requires the board to review each assessment and to prioritize and award grants to the counties.
The bill would require each county to report specified data to the board, on or before January 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, pertaining to offenders sentenced as felons to serve in local correctional facilities and felons released from prison to community supervision. The bill would require the board to summarize these data and report the summaries to the Governor and the Legislature, on or before May 15, 2016, and annually thereafter.
By imposing data collection and reporting duties on local governments, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would appropriate an undetermined sum to the board for purposes of funding the grants. The bill would state findings and declarations of the Legislature regarding criminal justice realignment.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
The bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","This bill establishes a Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program to assist counties with the creation or expansion of infrastructure that allows each county to collect and report criminal justice information required under this Act. The Board of State and Community Corrections shall award grants to assist counties with the creation or expansion of infrastructure that allows each county to collect and report criminal justice information required under this Act. Each local community corrections partnership established pursuant to this Act shall report to the board on the county's ability to collect and report the data required by this Act. The report shall include a local plan that identifies the additional resources necessary for that county to consistently collect and report criminal justice information. The board shall review realignment, and prioritize and award grants pursuant to, each assessment submitted. Grant funds shall be used for programs that are identified in the local plan submitted. The board shall submit to the Legislature a report on participation in day reporting release programs and on the ability of each county to collect and report criminal justice information required under this Act."
"The Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, approved by the voters as Proposition 1 at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds in the amount of $7,545,000,000 to finance a water quality, supply, and infrastructure improvement program. Proposition 1 makes available $100,000,000 of the bond proceeds, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for projects to protect and enhance an urban creek and its tributaries that meets certain requirements.
This bill would require a public agency receiving an appropriation from the $100,000,000 to give priority to projects that are located in, or directly adjacent to, a disadvantaged community within a distressed watershed and that may also provide greenspace or other venues for physical activities.
Existing law establishes the Strategic Growth Council consisting of specified members and requires the council to, among other things, develop and administer the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through projects that implement land use, housing, transportation, and agricultural land preservation practices to support infill and compact development and that support other related and coordinated public policy objectives.
This bill would require the council to develop and implement the Disadvantaged Community Enhancement Program to award grants to disadvantaged communities, as defined, to facilitate projects for community enhancement improvements that provide to eligible applicants multiple environmental benefits.","This bill amends the Water Code to establish a Strategic Growth Council to develop and implement a program to provide funding opportunities to address watershed-related infrastructure challenges in California's most disadvantaged communities and promote projects that provide cobenefits that address physical blight and deficiencies. The program requires the council to award grants to disadvantaged communities to facilitate projects for community enhancement improvements that provide to such communities multiple environmental benefits, including: land acquisitions in urban settings of blighted or contaminated properties serving little benefit for greenspace conversion; urban forestry and landscaping projects; park development and land protection for passive or active recreation; park conversion and conservancy of lands to serve greenspace and sustainable recreation; and greenspace sequestration mitigation."
"Existing law authorizes the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to impose, in addition to any other tax that it is authorized to impose, a transactions and use tax at a rate of 0.5% for the funding of specified transportation-related projects and programs, subject to various requirements, including the adoption of an expenditure plan and voter approval. Existing law authorizes the MTA to seek voter approval to extend the transactions and use tax pursuant to an amended ordinance, subject to various requirements, including adoption of an amended expenditure plan that, among other things, updates certain cost estimates and identifies expected completion dates for projects and programs under the previous expenditure plan, and also requires the amended expenditure plan to be included in an updated long range transportation plan, as specified.
This bill would delete the above-referenced provisions relative to extension of the transactions and use tax and an amended ordinance and expenditure plan, The bill would instead authorize the MTA to impose an additional transportation transactions and use tax at a maximum rate of 0.5% as long as a specified existing 0.5% transactions and use tax is in effect, and at a maximum rate of 1% thereafter, as specified, for a period of time determined by the MTA, if certain conditions exist and subject to various requirements, including the adoption of an expenditure plan and voter approval, as specified.
The Transactions and Use Tax Law limits to 2% the combined rate of all transactions and use taxes imposed in any county, with certain exceptions.
This bill would exempt the transactions and use tax authorized by the bill from this limitation.","Amends the Public Utilities Code to authorize the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to impose a transactions and use tax at a rate of 0.5 percent applicable in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of the County.<n><n>Requires the tax proposed to be proposed in a transactions and use tax ordinance that conforms with Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 72, inclusive, of the Transactions and Use Tax Law) and that is approved by a majority of the entire membership of theMTA, and that is approved by a majority of the entire membership, before it becomes operative.<n><n>Allows the tax to be imposed only if the proposing ordinance is approved by two-thirds of the voters, in an election held on November 4, 2008, or at a subsequent election and, if so approved, shall become operative as provided in this Act.<n><n>Requires the proposing ordinance to specify, in addition to the rate of tax and other matters as required by the Transactions and Use Tax Law, that the net revenues derived from the tax are to be administered by theMTA. Limits the amount of such costs of administration by the State Board of Equalization to 1.5% of the revenues derived from the tax.<n><n>Directs theMTA, during the period in which the ordinance is operative, to allocate 20%"
"The Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 provides that a civil penalty for a violation of the Labor Code may be recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee, as specified.
This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to that provision.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Labor Code of California to allow aggrieved employees to recover through a civil action the maximum civil penalty that is specified in such Code for any employment violation, provided that the employer abates each violation alleged by the employee and is in compliance with the underlying statutes. Authorizes a court to award a lesser amount than the maximum specified penalty if, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case, to do otherwise would result in an award that is unjust, arbitrary, and oppressive, or confiscatory. <n>Establishes the maximum civil penalty for such a violation: (1) if at the time of the alleged violation the person does not employ one or more employees; (2) if, at the time of the alleged violation, the person employs one or more employees, the civil penalty is one hundred dollars ($100) for each aggrieved employee per pay period for the initial violation and two hundred dollars ($200) for each subsequent violation; and (3) if the alleged violation is a failure to act by the Labor and Workplace Development Agency, or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, there shall be no"
"(1) Existing law regulates the terms and conditions of residential tenancies. Existing law, the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, prescribes statewide limits on the application of local rent control with regard to certain properties, including those that have a certificate of occupancy issued after February 1, 1995. Existing law requires a local ordinance or charter controlling residential rent prices that requires registration of rents to provide for the certification of permissible rent levels and prescribes a process in this regard, including a requirement that, upon the request, a local agency provide a landlord and a tenant with a certificate reflecting the permissible rent levels of the rental unit. Existing law provides that the permissible rent levels reflected in the certificate are, in the absence of intentional misrepresentation or fraud, binding and conclusive upon the local agency unless the determination of the permissible rent levels is appealed.
This bill would specify that the certification provisions described above, on and after January 1, 2016, do not apply to tenancies for which the owner of residential property may establish the initial rent under the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, as specified. The bill would except from this exclusion a tenancy for which the property owner provides the local rent control agency with a writing, signed under penalty of perjury, of the tenancy’s initial rent that complies with the agency’s requirements, which would create a rebuttable presumption that the statement of the initial rent is correct. By expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Prohibits a local agency from maintaining any action to recover excess rent against any property owner who has registered the unit with it within specified time limits if the initial certification of permissible rent levels affecting that particular property has not been completed, unless the delay is willfully and intentionally caused by the property owner or is a result of court proceedings or further administrative proceedings ordered by a court."
"The State Civil Service Act generally requires the workweek of state employees to be 40 hours, and the workday of state employees to be 8 hours. Under the act, it is the policy of the state to avoid the necessity for overtime work whenever possible.
The Psychiatric Technicians Law provides for the licensure and regulation of psychiatric technicians (PTs) by the Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians of the State of California.
This bill would prohibit a PT or psychiatric technician assistant (PTA) employed by the State of California in a specified type of facility from being compelled to work in excess of the regularly scheduled workweek or work shift, except under certain circumstances. The bill would authorize a PT or PTA to volunteer or agree to work hours in addition to his or her regularly scheduled workweek or work shift, but the refusal to accept those additional hours would not constitute patient abandonment or neglect or be grounds for discrimination, dismissal, discharge, or any other penalty or employment decision adverse to the PT or PTA. The bill would require management and supervisors to consider employees in a specified order of priority in order to fulfill the additional staffing needs of a facility.","(Sec. 1) Expresses the intent of the State of California to ensure that there is a process that management and supervisors in a state health care facility are required to follow to avoid on-the-spot mandatory overtime of any psychiatric technician or psychiatric technician assistant whose regularly scheduled work shift is complete, and to prevent circumstances where an employee is stopped at the gate of, for example, a Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and California Correctional Health Care Services facility, and is instructed to return to work at the end of the employee's regularly scheduled work shift. Defines ""emergency situation"" to include: (1) an act of terrorism, a natural disaster, a widespread disease outbreak, or an emergency declared by a warden, superintendent, or executive director; and (2) a catastrophic event that results in such a large number of patients in need of immediate medical treatment for which the facility is incapable of providing sufficient PTs or PTAs to attend to the patients without resorting to mandatory overtime.(Sec. 2) Prohibits a facility from requiring a PT or PTA to work in excess of a regularly scheduled workweek or work shift. Allows a PT or PTA to volunteer or agree to work hours in addition to his or her regularly scheduled workweek or work shift but the refusal by a PT or"
"Exiting law requires insurers issuing group or individual policies of health insurance that covers hospital, medical, or surgical expenses to reimburse each complete claim, as specified, as soon as practical but no later than 30 working days after receipt of the complete claim. Within 30 working days after receipt of the claim, an insurer can contest or deny a claim, as specified. An insurer is required to pay the greater of $15 per year or interest, as specified, on a claim that is not contested or denied and that has not been delivered to the claimant within 30 working days after receipt. Existing law also authorizes the insurer to request reasonable additional information about the claim, and requires the service provider making the claim to submit the relevant information requested to the insurer within 15 working days. Existing law allows the insurer 30 working days after receipt of the additional information to reconsider the claim, and requires the insurer to pay the greater of $15 per year, or interest, as specified, on a claim that is undergoing reconsideration and that has not been delivered to the claimant within 30 working days after receipt of the additional information. Under existing law these requirements are not applicable to claims to which specified exceptions apply, and the insurer is required to give written notice to the provider if any of those exceptions apply within 30 working days of receipt of the claim.
This bill would require an insurer, under those circumstances, to instead pay to the claimant the greater of $25 per year or the interest, as specified.","This bill amends the Insurance Code, with respect to hospital, medical, and surgical expenses, to require an insurer that issues a group or individual health insurance policy that covers hospital, medical, or surgical expenses, to reimburse each complete claim, or portion thereof, as soon as practical, but no later than 30 working days after receipt of the complete claim by the insurer. However, an insurer may contest or deny a claim, or portion thereof, by notifying the claimant, in writing, that the claim is contested or denied within 30 working days after receipt of the complete claim by the insurer. The notice must: (1) identify the portion of the claim that is contested and the specific information needed from the provider to reconsider the claim; and (2) identify the portion that is denied and the specific reasons for the denial, including the factual and legal basis known at that time by the insurer for each reason. The insurer shall provide a copy of such notice to each insured who received services pursuant to the claim that was contested or denied and to the insured health care provider that provided the services at issue. The notice must include a statement advising the provider who submitted the claim on behalf of the insured or pursuant to a contract for alternative rates of payment and the insured that either may seek review by the department"
"Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime.
The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires a health insurance issuer issuing health insurance coverage to comply with minimum medical loss ratios, and to provide an annual rebate to each insured if the medical loss ratio of the amount of the revenue expended by the issuer on costs to the total amount of premium revenue is less than a certain percentage, as specified. Existing law requires health care service plans to comply with those requirements.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to the latter provision.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code to require every health care service plan that issues, sells, renews, or offers health care service plan contracts for health care coverage in California to provide an annual rebate to each enrollee if the ratio of the amount of premium revenue expended by the plan on the costs for reimbursement for clinical services provided to enrollees and for activities that improve health care quality is less than: (1) 85% for a plan offering coverage in the large group market; and (2) 80% for a plan offering coverage in the small group or individual market. Every such plan shall also provide any rebate owing to an enrollee no later than August 1 of the calendar year following the year for which the ratio was calculated."
"Existing law permits property to be titled in a trust, and provides that, upon the death of a settlor of a trust, the property of the deceased settlor that was subject to the power of revocation at the time of the settlor’s death is subject to the claims of creditors of the deceased settlor’s estate. Existing law defines specified terms for the purposes of these provisions.
This bill would define the terms “probate estate” and “trust estate” for the purposes of these provisions and clarify that certain uses of the term “estate” in existing law refer to a probate estate.","(Sec. 2) Subjects the property of the deceased settlor that was subject to the power revocation at the time of the settlor's death to the claims of creditors of the deceased settlors estate to the extent that the deceased settlors estate is inadequate to satisfy those claims and expenses. Allows the deceased settlor to direct the priority of sources of payment of debts established by the deceased settlors death. Prohibits any filing of a petition from the personal representative of the deceased settlor to alter the priority of payment from the source of the trust estate to the personal representative of the deceased settlors death. (Sec. 3) Authorizes the trustee of a trust established by the deceased settlor to file with the court a proposed notice to creditors of the trust established by the deceased settlor, but requires the filing to be made with the superior court in the county in which the deceased settlor resided or if none of the settlors resided in any county in which the trust property was located at the time of death, or if none of the settlors resided in any county in which the trust property was located at the time of the deceased settlor's death."
"Existing law establishes the Adult Education Block Grant Program under the administration of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The program requires the chancellor and the Superintendent, with the advice of the Executive Director of the State Board of Education, to divide the state into adult education regions and approve one adult education consortium in each adult education region, as specified. The program also requires the chancellor and the Superintendent, with the advice of the executive director, to certify, no later than July 31, 2015, the amount of state funds required to be expended for adult education by a school district and county office of education, as specified. The program further requires the chancellor and the Superintendent to apportion funds appropriated for the program in the Budget Act of 2015 to each school district and county office of education by August 30, 2015, in accordance with a specified formula and, by October 30, 2015, to allocate the funds that remain after the apportionment to each consortium, as specified.

"The California Constitution prohibits the Legislature from imposing taxes for local purposes, but allows the Legislature to authorize local governments to impose them.
This bill would authorize a local public entity that supplies water at retail or wholesale for the benefit of persons within the service area or area of jurisdiction of that public entity to impose, by ordinance, an excise tax on an excessive user of water, at a rate not to exceed 300% of the purchase price of the water, if the ordinance proposing the tax is approved by
2/3
of the electors voting on the measure and the revenue from the tax is equally distributed between the public entity and the State Water Resources Control Board for water conservation efforts within the jurisdiction of the public entity.
Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to suspend the driving privilege of a person who is involved in an accident and fails to provide evidence of financial responsibility, as specified, at the time of the accident. Under existing law, the suspension period is one year, as specified, except that the suspension must be reinstated if the person fails to maintain proof of financial responsibility for 3 years. However, upon application and if certain criteria are met, the department may restrict the person’s driving privilege, in lieu of suspending it pursuant to this provision, in specified situations.
This bill would, commencing July 1, 2016, also authorize the department to restrict a person’s driving privilege, in lieu of suspending it, in order to allow the person to drive to school. For purposes of this authorization, the bill would define “school” to mean a California community college campus, a California State University campus, a University of California campus, or a private postsecondary educational institution.","Authorizes a local public entity that supplies water at retail or wholesale for the benefit of persons within its jurisdiction to impose an excise tax on an excessive user of water, at a rate not to exceed 300% of the purchase price, if both of the following conditions are met: (1) the ordinance proposing such tax is approved by two-thirds of the electors voting on the measure pursuant to Article XIII C of the California Constitution; and (2) the revenue from the tax is equally distributed between the public entity and the State Water Resources Control Board for local water conservation efforts within the entity's jurisdiction.

"Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility, and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. The Green Tariff Shared Renewables Program requires a participating utility, defined as being an electrical corporation with 100,000 or more customers in California, to file with the commission an application requesting approval of a tariff to implement a program enabling ratepayers to participate in electrical generation facilities that use eligible renewable energy resources, consistent with certain legislative findings and statements of intent. Existing law requires the commission, by July 1, 2014, to issue a decision concerning the participating utility’s application, determining whether to approve or disapprove the application, with or without modifications. Existing law requires the commission, after notice and opportunity for public comment, to approve the application if the commission determines that the proposed program is reasonable and consistent with the legislative findings and statements of intent and requires the commission to require that a participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program be administered in accordance with specified provisions. Existing law repeals the program on January 1, 2019.
This bill would require the commission to additionally require that a participating utility’s green tariff shared renewables program permit a participating customer to subscribe to the program and be provided with a nonbinding estimate of reasonably anticipated bill credits and bill charges, as determined by the commission, for a period of up to 20 years.
Under existing law, a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.
Because the bill would require action by the commission to implement its requirements and a violation of those requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding the definition of a crime.

"(1) Existing law, when a person is arrested without a warrant, requires the person, if not otherwise released and without unnecessary delay, to be taken before the nearest or most accessible magistrate in the county in which the offense is triable, unless certain exemptions apply, including that the person was arrested for intoxication only and no further proceedings are desirable.
This bill would exempt a person from the requirement of, without unnecessary delay, being taken before the nearest or most accessible magistrate in the county in which the offense is triable if the person is arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and the person is delivered to a hospital for medical treatment that prohibits immediate delivery before a magistrate.
(2) Existing law requires the Department of Parks and Recreation to protect the state park system and the state vehicular recreation area and trail system from damage and to preserve the peace therein. Existing law provides that a person who violates the rules and regulations established by the department is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by imprisonment, as specified, except that at the time a particular action is commenced, the judge may, considering the recommendation of the prosecuting attorney, reduce the charged offense from a misdemeanor to an infraction. Existing law also requires that a person who is convicted of the offense after that reduction be punished by a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $1,000.
This bill would instead make a person who violates those rules and regulations guilty of either a misdemeanor, punishable as provided under existing law, or an infraction, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000. The bill would delete the mandatory minimum fine.
(3) Existing law, the Interstate Compact for Juveniles, adopted by this state and effective until January 1, 2016, establishes an interstate commission of the compacting states to, among other things, oversee, supervise, and coordinate the interstate movement of juveniles.
This bill would delete the repeal date of these provisions, and would thereby extend the operation of the provisions indefinitely.
(4) This bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive changes.","Declares that each class of public officers or employees declared by law to be peace officers shall meet all the following minimum standards: (1) be a citizen of the United States or a permanent resident alien who is eligible for and has applied for citizenship, except as provided in the Vehicle Code; (2) be at least 18 years of age; (3) be fingerprinted for purposes of search of local, state, and national fingerprint files to disclose a criminal record; (4) be of good moral character; (5) be a high school graduate, pass the General Education Development Test or other high school equivalency test approved by the State Department of Education that indicates high school graduation level, pass the California High School Proficiency Examination, or have attained a two-year, four-year, or advanced degree from an accredited college or university; and (6) be either a United States public school, an accredited United States Department of Defense high school, or an accredited or approved public or nonpublic high school.

"The Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act generally imposes a surcharge on amounts paid by every person in the state for intrastate telephone service to provide revenues sufficient to fund “911” emergency telephone system costs, and requires the Office of Emergency Services to annually determine the surcharge rate. Commencing with the calculation made October 1, 2015, existing law requires the office to compute the charges applicable to the intrastate portion of prepaid mobile telephony services, as provided.
The Prepaid Mobile Telephony Service Surcharge Collection Act establishes a prepaid MTS surcharge, as defined, based upon a percentage of the sales price of each retail transaction that occurs in this state for prepaid mobile telephony services, as defined, that is imposed in lieu of any charges imposed pursuant to the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act and specified Public Utility Commission surcharges. That act requires the prepaid MTS surcharge to be annually calculated by the State Board of Equalization by November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2015, by using the emergency telephone user surcharge rate reported by the office and specified Public Utility Commission surcharges.
The Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act requires the office to notify the board of the emergency telephone user surcharge rate and the emergency telephone user surcharge rate applicable to prepaid mobile telephony services by October 15 of each year.
This bill would instead require the office to notify the board of the emergency telephone user surcharge rate by October 1.

The surcharge rate shall be determined by dividing the costs (including incremental costs) of the Office of Emergency Services estimates for the current fiscal year of 911 costs by its estimate of the charges for intrastate telephone communications services, the intrastate portion of prepaid mobile telephony services, and VoIP (voice over Internet Protocol) service to which the surcharge will apply for the period of January 1, 2015, to December 31, inclusive, of the next succeeding calendar year. The surcharge rate in any year shall not be greater than three-quarters of 1% nor less than one-half of 1%.

This bill would extend the operative date of this requirement to January 1, 2018.
(2) Existing law defines a tour bus to include any bus operated by or for a charter-party carrier of passengers or a passenger stage corporation, with a bus in this respect defined to mean any vehicle designed, used, or maintained for carrying more than 10 persons, including the driver. Existing law provides for the Department of the California Highway Patrol to regulate the safe operation of various classes of vehicles, including tour buses. A violation of various statutes and regulations governing tour buses and operators of tour buses is a crime.
Existing law also requires the department, at least once every 13 months, to inspect every maintenance facility or terminal of any person who at any time operates any bus. Existing law requires that if the bus operation includes more than 100 buses, the inspection shall be without prior notice.
This bill would require the department, if a tour bus has received an unsatisfactory compliance rating, to conduct a followup inspection between 30 and 90 days after the initial inspection during which the unsatisfactory rating was received. The bill would require the department to order a tour bus out of service upon determining during a terminal inspection or at any other time that the condition of a tour bus is such that it has multiple safety violations of a nature that operation of the tour bus could constitute an imminent danger to public safety. The bill would prohibit the tour bus from being operated with passengers until all of the safety violations have been corrected and the department has verified the correction of the safety violations upon a subsequent inspection by the department of the tour bus, which shall occur within five business days of the submission of a reinspection request from the tour bus carrier.

This bill would declare that during prescribed periods excessive water use by a residential customer in a single-family residence or by a customer in a multiunit housing complex, as specified, is prohibited. This bill, during prescribed periods, would require each urban retail water supplier to establish a method to identify and discourage excessive water use. This bill would authorize as a method to identify and discourage excessive water use the establishment of a rate structure that includes block tiers, water budgets, or rate surcharges over and above base rates for excessive water use by residential customers. This bill would authorize as a method to identify and discourage excessive water use the establishment of an excessive water use ordinance, rule, or tariff condition that includes a definition of or procedure to identify and address excessive water use, as prescribed, and would make a violation of this excessive water use ordinance, rule, or tariff condition an infraction or administrative civil penalty and would authorize the penalty for a violation to be based on conditions identified by the urban retail water supplier. By creating a new infraction, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

"Existing law defines and proscribes the crimes of human trafficking, solicitation, and prostitution. Existing law provides that if a defendant has been convicted of solicitation or prostitution and has completed any term of probation for that conviction, the defendant may petition the court for relief if the defendant can establish by clear and convincing evidence that the conviction was the result of his or her status as a victim of human trafficking. Existing law authorizes a court to issue an order that (1) sets forth a finding that the defendant was a victim of human trafficking, as specified, (2) dismisses the accusation or information against the defendant, or orders other relief, and (3) notifies the Department of Justice that the defendant was a victim of human trafficking when he or she committed the crime and the relief that has been ordered.
Existing law authorizes a person who was adjudicated a ward of the juvenile court for solicitation or prostitution to, upon reaching 18 years of age, petition the court to have his or her record sealed, as specified.
This bill would establish a separate petition process for a person who has been arrested for, convicted of, or adjudicated a ward of the juvenile court for, committing a nonviolent offense, as defined, while he or she was a victim of human trafficking. The bill would require the petitioner to establish that the arrest, conviction, or adjudication was the direct result of being a victim of human trafficking in order to obtain relief. The bill would require the petition for relief to be submitted under penalty of perjury, thereby expanding the scope of a crime. The bill would authorize the court, upon making specified findings, to vacate the conviction or adjudication and issue an order that provides the relief described above and also provides for the sealing and destruction of the petitioner’s arrest and court records, as specified. The bill would require that the petition be made within a reasonable time after the person has ceased to be a victim of human trafficking, or within a reasonable time after the person has sought services for being a victim of human trafficking, whichever is later. The bill would provide that official documentation, as defined, of a petitioner’s status as a victim of human trafficking may be introduced as evidence that his or her participation in the offense was the result of the petitioner’s status as a victim of human trafficking. The bill would provide that a petitioner or his or her attorney is not required to appear in person at a hearing for the relief described above if the court finds a compelling reason why the petitioner cannot attend the hearing and may appear via alternate specified methods. The bill would prohibit the disclosure of the full name of a petitioner in the record of a proceeding related to his or her petition that is accessible by the public. The bill would authorize a petitioner who has obtained the relief described above to lawfully deny or refuse to acknowledge an arrest, conviction, or adjudication that is set aside pursuant to that relief. By expanding the scope of a crime and increasing the number of records local agencies would be required to seal and destroy, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.

"Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
Existing law continuously appropriates specified portions of the annual proceeds in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to various programs, including 5% for the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program, for expenditures to provide transit operating or capital assistance consistent with specified criteria. Existing law provides for distribution of available funds under the program by a specified formula to recipient transit agencies by the Controller, upon approval of the recipient transit agency’s proposed expenditures by the Department of Transportation.
This bill would require a recipient transit agency to demonstrate that each expenditure of program moneys allocated to the agency does not supplant another source of funds. The bill would authorize a recipient transit agency that does not submit an expenditure for funding under the program in a particular fiscal year to retain its funding share for expenditure in a subsequent fiscal year for a maximum of 4 years. The bill would allow a recipient transit agency to loan or transfer its funding share in any particular fiscal year to another recipient transit agency within the same region, or to apply to the department to reassign, to other eligible expenditures under the program, any savings of surplus moneys from an approved and completed expenditure under the program or from an approved expenditure that is no longer a priority, as specified. The bill would also allow a recipient transit agency to apply to the department for a letter of no prejudice for any eligible expenditures under the program for which the department has authorized a disbursement of funds, and, if granted, would allow the recipient transit agency to expend its own moneys and to be eligible for future reimbursement from the program, under specified conditions. The bill would also require a recipient transit agency to provide additional information to the department to the extent funding is sought for capital projects.","Creates the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program to provide operating and capital assistance for transit agencies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve mobility, with a priority on serving disadvantaged communities.

Requires at least 50% of the total moneys received pursuant to this Act to be expended on projects or services that meet the requirements of specified subdivisions and benefit the disadvantaged communities, as identified consistent with the guidance developed by the State Air Resources Board."
"Existing law with respect to claims against public entities authorizes the “board,” as defined, to assess a surcharge to the state entity against which an approved claim was filed in an amount not to exceed 15% of the claim.

This bill would specify that the Department of General Services may assess this surcharge, would require the surcharge to be deposited into the Service Revolving Fund, and would specify that the surcharge may be appropriated to the department in the annual Budget Act.
Existing law defines a human trafficking caseworker to mean a human trafficking caseworker as defined by the Evidence Code.
This bill would expand that definition to include a human trafficking caseworker who is employed by a homeless services provider that serves homeless children or youth and has completed a minimum of 8 hours of training focused on victims of human trafficking from the Runaway and Homeless Youth Training and Technical Assistance Center.
Existing law authorizes the State Public Works Board to issue up to $270,000,000 in revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes to finance the acquisition, design, and construction of approved adult local criminal justice facilities, setting aside $20,000,000 to be awarded to the County of Napa.
This bill would require that $20,000,000 of the amount issued by the board in revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes be set aside and awarded to the County of Napa without the submission of any further adult local criminal justice facility proposal. The bill would also authorize those funds to be utilized in conjunction with a partial award made to the County of Napa pursuant to other specified provisions.
Article XXXIV of the California Constitution, among other things, prohibits any state public body from developing, constructing, or acquiring a low-rent housing project before a majority of the qualified electors vote upon and approve the project. Existing law provides that the words “develop, construct, or acquire” for the purposes of that constitutional provision shall not be interpreted to include specified activities of a state public body.
This bill would include in those specified activities the financing for a specified low-rent housing project by a state public body, as provided.
Senate Bill 839 of the 2015–16 Regular Session (SB 839) would authorize the State Air Resources Board to enter into agreements with private entities and receive, on behalf of the state, contributions from private sources in the form of equipment or money in order to expedite the processing of applications, resolutions, and executive orders pertaining to a specified exception to the requirement that vehicles be equipped with pollution control devices or systems and the authorization to sell and install aftermarket and performance parts with a valid executive order. SB 839 would require all moneys received to be separately accounted for, be deposited into the Air Pollution Control Fund, and available to the state board for these purposes upon appropriation of the Legislature.
This bill would repeal that authorization for the state board to enter into those agreements and the requirement for the deposit of those moneys received, if Section 43011.3 of the Health and Safety Code is added by Section 24 of SB 839 and SB 839 becomes effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is enacted after SB 839.

"(1) Existing law generally prohibits the possession or transfer of assault weapons, except for the sale, purchase, importation, or possession of assault weapons by specified individuals, including law enforcement officers. Under existing law, “assault weapon” means, among other things, a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or a semiautomatic pistol that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and has any one of specified attributes, including, for rifles, a thumbhole stock, and for pistols, a second handgrip.
This bill would revise this definition of “assault weapon” to mean a semiautomatic centerfire rifle, or a semiautomatic pistol that does not have a fixed magazine but has any one of those specified attributes. The bill would also define “fixed magazine” to mean an ammunition feeding device contained in, or permanently attached to, a firearm in such a manner that the device cannot be removed without disassembly of the firearm action.
By expanding the definition of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law requires that any person who, within this state, possesses an assault weapon, except as otherwise provided, be punished as a felony or for a period not to exceed one year in a county jail.
This bill would exempt from punishment under that provision a person who possessed an assault weapon prior to January 1, 2017, if specified requirements are met.
(3) Existing law requires that, with specified exceptions, any person who, prior to January 1, 2001, lawfully possessed an assault weapon prior to the date it was defined as an assault weapon, and which was not specified as an assault weapon at the time of lawful possession, register the firearm with the Department of Justice. Existing law permits the Department of Justice to charge a fee for registration of up to $20 per person but not to exceed the actual processing costs of the department. Existing law, after the department establishes fees sufficient to reimburse the department for processing costs, requires fees charged to increase at a rate not to exceed the legislatively approved annual cost-of-living adjustment for the department’s budget or as otherwise increased through the Budget Act. Existing law requires those fees to be deposited into the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account.

The bill would permit the department to increase the $20 registration fee as long as it does not exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. The bill would also require registrations to be submitted electronically via the Internet utilizing a public-facing application made available by the department. The bill would require the registration to contain specified information, including, but not limited to, a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely and specified information about the registrant. The bill would permit the department to charge a fee of up to $15 per person for registration through the Internet, not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department to be paid and deposited, as specified, for purposes of the registration program. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing those provisions and would exempt those regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would also make technical and conforming changes.

Existing law requires the program to accept a reduced payment in full satisfaction of the fine or bail if the program participant certifies under penalty of perjury that he or she receives specified public benefits or his or her income is 125% or less of the current poverty guidelines. If the driving privilege of an amnesty program participant or a person who is in good standing in a comprehensive collection program has been suspended due to a Vehicle Code violation that is subject to the amnesty program, existing law requires the court to issue and file a certificate with the Department of Motor Vehicles demonstrating that the participant has appeared in court, paid the fine, or has otherwise satisfied the court.

For applications submitted prior to January 1, 2017, the bill would require the court to issue and file the certificate no later than March 31, 2017. The bill would require, for applications submitted on or before March 31, 2017, that all terms and procedures related to a participant’s payment plans remain in effect after that date.","This bill amends the Vehicle Code to require each county in California to establish a one-time amnesty program for unpaid court-ordered fines and bail.

"Existing law generally punishes the willful disobedience of a court order as contempt of court by imprisonment in a county jail for a term not exceeding 6 months, a fine not exceeding $1,000, or both that imprisonment and fine. Existing law makes the willful and knowing violation of specified protective orders or stay-away court orders punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine for a first offense, and makes a 2nd or subsequent conviction for a violation of these specified protective orders or stay-away court orders occurring within 7 years of a prior conviction and involving an act of violence or credible threat of violence punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony. If probation is granted upon conviction of a willful and knowing violation of these specified protective orders or stay-away court orders, existing law requires the court to impose a minimum period of probation of 36 months, a criminal protective order protecting the victim from further acts of violence, threats, stalking, sexual abuse, and harassment, a minimum fine of $500, successful completion of a batterer’s program, and a specified amount of appropriate community service, among other requirements.
Under existing law, any person who willfully inflicts corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon a spouse or former spouse, cohabitant or former cohabitant, fiancé or fiancée, or someone with whom the offender has, or previously had, an engagement or dating relationship, or the mother or father of the offender’s child, is guilty of a felony or a misdemeanor. Upon a conviction under that provision, existing law authorizes the sentencing court to issue an order restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim for up to 10 years.
This bill would make a willful and knowing violation of the above protective order issued for the conviction of inflicting a corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine. The bill would make a 2nd or subsequent violation occurring within 7 years involving an act of violence or a credible threat of violence punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor.

The Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes cities and counties to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing law authorizes districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which conforms generally to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Exemptions from state sales and use taxes are incorporated into these laws.
This bill would exempt from those taxes the gross receipts from the sale of, and the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of, firearms, ammunition, and hunting supplies purchased by an individual in the 2-day period beginning at 12:01 a.m. on the first Saturday in September and ending at midnight the next day and the 2-day period beginning at 12:01 a.m. on the first Saturday in October and ending at midnight the next day, as provided.

The bill would require the commission to annually report to the Legislature the activities and accomplishments of the program.
(2) Existing law, with specified exceptions, generally requires the State Lands Commission, on and after July 1, 2006, to deposit all revenue, money, and remittances, derived from mineral extraction leases on state tide and submerged lands, including tideland oil revenue, into the General Fund, to be available upon appropriation by the Legislature for specified purposes. Existing law establishes the Land Bank Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, from which the commission may expend moneys for management and improvement of real property held by the commission, as trustee, to provide open space, habitat for plants and animals, and public access.
This bill would require that, for the 2017–18 fiscal year, out of those funds deposited into the General Fund by the commission, the sum of $500,000 be transferred to the Land Bank Fund and be available, upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act, for the purpose of implementing the coastal hazard removal and remediation program. The bill would require that, commencing with the 2018–19 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, an amount sufficient to bring the unencumbered balance of the Land Bank Fund available for the purpose of implementing the program to $500,000 be transferred to that fund and be available, upon an appropriation in the annual Budget Act, for the purpose of implementing the program.","Requires the State Lands Commission, upon appropriation of moneys by the Legislature, to administer a coastal hazard removal and remediation program to: (1) complete an in-depth inventory of legacy oil and gas wells and other coastal hazards along the California coastline; (2) survey, study, and monitor oil seepage in state waters and tidelands to determine oil seepage locations, rates, and environmental impacts; and (3) begin the process of remediating improperly abandoned legacy oil and gas wells that have a high risk of leaking oil and, with any remaining funds, remove other identified coastal hazards."

The federal Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended the operation of those provisions to debt that is discharged before January 1, 2015. The federal Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended the operation of those provisions to debt that is discharged before January 1, 2017, and provides that its discharge provisions apply to specified written agreements entered into before January 1, 2017.
This bill would conform to that additional discharge provision relating to specified written agreements and the federal extensions, some of which would be applied retroactively. The bill would discharge indebtedness for related penalties and interest and would make legislative findings and declarations regarding the public purpose served by the bill.

Amounts owed by a claimant are due if the claimant, or his or her surviving spouse, ceases to occupy the premises as his or her residential dwelling, dies, disposes of the property, or allows specified taxes and special assessments to become delinquent, as provided. Existing law requires that the residential dwelling be owned by the claimant, the claimant and spouse, or the claimant and another specified individual. Existing law requires a claimant to file a claim containing specified information, including a description of the residential dwelling, under penalty of perjury.
This bill would provide that “owned” for these purposes includes the interest of a beneficiary of a special needs trust.

This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to revise the definition of ""residential dwelling."" Excludes from such definition: (1) any residential dwelling in which the owners do not have an equity of at least 40 percent of the full value of the property as determined for purposes of property taxation or at least 40 percent of the fair market value as determined by the Controller of the State; and (2) any residential dwelling in which the claimant does not receive a secured tax bill on which the claimant's interest is held as a possessory interest, unless the claimant obtains the written consent of the vendor under the contract of sale, or the holder of the reversionary interest upon termination of taxes and the creation of a life estate, for postponement of taxes and the creation of a secured tax bill on which the claimant's interest is held as a possessory interest."
"Existing law establishes a workers’ compensation system, administered by the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers’ Compensation, to compensate an employee for injuries sustained in the course of his or her employment. Existing law authorizes an insurer, employer, or entity that provides physician network services to establish or modify a medical provider network for the provision of medical treatment to injured employees, and requires the administrative director to contract with individual physicians or an independent medical review organization to perform medical provider network independent medical reviews. Existing law provides that if a treatment or diagnostic service remains disputed after a 3rd physician’s opinion, the injured employee may request a medical provider network independent medical review. Existing law requires the review to use standards established in statute or use the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine’s Occupational Medicine Practice Guidelines.
This bill would delete the authorization to use the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine’s Occupational Medicine Practice Guidelines as standards for those independent medical reviews. The bill would make additional technical, nonsubstantive changes.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 12, 2003.

"The Political Reform Act of 1974 generally requires elected officials, candidates for elective office, and committees formed primarily to support or oppose a candidate for public office or a ballot measure, along with other entities, to file periodic campaign statements. The act requires that these campaign statements contain prescribed information related to campaign contributions and expenditures of the filing entities.
This bill would correct an erroneous cross-reference in these provisions and would make other technical, nonsubstantive changes.","Amends the Government Code, with respect to State campaign statements, to require them to contain: (1) the total amount of contributions received and the total cumulative amount of expenditures made; (2) the total amount of expenditures made from persons who have given a cumulative amount of one hundred dollars ($100) or more; (3) the total amount of contributions received from persons who have given a cumulative amount of less than one hundred dollars ($100); (4) the balance of cash and cash equivalents on hand at the beginning and the end of the period covered by the statement; (5) if the cumulative amount of contributions, including loans, received from a person is one hundred dollars ($100) or more, and such contribution or loan has been received from that person during the period covered by the statement, all of the individual's or employer's name, street address, occupation, name of the business, or self-employed name of the business; (6) the due date and interest rate of the loan; (7) the cumulative payment made or received to date at the end of the reporting period; (8) the balance outstanding at the end of the reporting period; and (9) the cumulative amount of contributions for each person, other than the filer, who is directly, indirectly, or contingently liable for repayment of a"

Existing law provides that, upon a finding of noncompliance, the Lake Alpine Water Company could be subject to suspension, amendment, or revocation of any permit issued pursuant to specified provisions, and that failure to comply with these provisions would be deemed a violation subject to specified fines, penalties, or other enforcement actions. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2017.
This bill would extend the operation of all these provisions until January 1, 2022, and would require the Lake Alpine Water Company to file the report on or before December 31, 2017, and biennially thereafter until January 1, 2022. By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Bear Lake Reservoir.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code to prohibit a participant in a recreational use from having bodily contact with the water at the Bear Lake Reservoir unless: the water treatment is in compliance with regulations of the State Water Resources Control Board, the disinfection is advanced, contact is no less than three times during and after intake and at post-treatment levels, and the reservoir is in compliance with regulations that delete or extend contact for no more than four months each year. The Lake Alpine Water Company must file annual reports with the government on the recreational uses at the reservoir.

"Existing law, the Small Business Financial Assistance Act of 2013, establishes the California Small Business Expansion Fund, a continuously appropriated fund that includes General Fund moneys. The act requires guarantees made by small business financial development corporations to be backed by funds on deposit in the corporation’s trust fund account or by receivables due from funds loaned from the corporation’s trust fund account to another fund in state government, as specified, and requires these loan guarantees to be secured by a reserve of at least 20%, until January 1, 2018, and 25% thereafter, as specified.
This bill would reduce the required reserve to 10% indefinitely and would make conforming changes with respect to related statements of legislative intent.

This bill would increase that maximum amount to 10 times the amount of funds on deposit in the expansion fund plus any receivables due from funds loaned from the expansion fund to another fund in state government, as specified, would apply that increased amount indefinitely, and would make conforming changes.
Existing law requires the program manager under the guidance of the executive director of the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank, to, among other things, authorize the distribution, transfer, and withholding of moneys in the expansion fund and trust funds.
This bill would also require the program manager to leverage moneys in the expansion fund and trust funds.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on December 10, 2014.

"Existing law regulates the care and maintenance of animals in the care of a pet store.
This bill would establish procedures for the care and maintenance of pets boarded at a pet boarding facility, including, but not limited to, sanitation, provision of enrichment for the pet, health of the pet, and safety. The bill would specifically authorize a city, county, or city and county to adopt ordinances that establish additional standards and requirements for a pet boarding facility. The bill would require an animal control officer, a humane officer, or a peace officer who detects a violation of specified provisions by a pet boarding facility operator to issue a notice to correct and would provide that if the operator complies with the notice to correct he or she would not be subject to an infraction, except as provided. The bill would provide that an operator that causes or allows harm or injury to an animal or allows an animal to be subject to an unreasonable risk of harm or injury is guilty of a misdemeanor. The bill, except as provided, would make a violation of these provisions an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed $250 for the first violation and not to exceed $1,000 for each subsequent violation. Because it would create a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

Existing law also requires that the attendance of pupils participating in independent study for 5 or more consecutive days, as specified, be included in computing the average daily attendance of the school district.
This bill would specify that, for the purpose of computing average daily attendance for pupils in independent study, a pupil serving as a member of a precinct board for an election shall not be required to participate in that activity for 5 or more consecutive days if specified requirements are met, and would specify that an absence for those reasons shall not be considered an absence for purposes of generating state apportionment payments.

Existing law requires the Director of Industrial Relations to determine the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality in which the public work is to be performed, and the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for holiday and overtime work.
Existing law includes, as per diem wages, employer payment for industry advancement and collective bargaining agreements administrative fees, provided that these payments are required under a collective bargaining agreement pertaining to the particular craft, classification, or type of work within the locality or the nearest labor market area at issue. Per diem wages also include employer payments for other purposes similar to those specified, including, but not limited to, certain apprenticeship or other training programs, to the extent that the cost of training is reasonably related to the amount of the contributions, and worker protection and assistance programs or committees established under the federal Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978, to the extent that the activities of the programs or committees are directed to the monitoring and enforcement of laws related to public works.

Existing law, subject to exceptions, authorizes the release of a prisoner from state prison if the court finds that the prisoner is terminally ill with an incurable condition caused by an illness or disease that would produce death within 6 months, as determined by a physician employed by the department, and that conditions under which the prisoner would be released or receive treatment do not pose a threat to public safety.
This bill would establish similar compassionate release provisions for a defendant who has been committed to a state hospital because, among other reasons, the defendant is incompetent to stand trial or to be adjudged to punishment, or the defendant is a mentally disordered offender, including a person who has been found not guilty by reason of insanity. The bill would make additional conforming changes and would authorize the director to adopt emergency regulations to implement these provisions.","Prohibits the admission of a person to a State hospital or other treatment facility or placed on outpatient status without having been evaluated by the community program director or a designee, if it appears to the court that the sanity of the defendant has been recovered fully.

"Existing law authorizes certain health care districts to use the design-build process when contracting for the construction of a building or improvements directly related to construction of a hospital or health facility building in those districts, as specified. Existing law sets forth the procurement process for design-build projects, as specified, and requires specified information submitted by design-build entities to be certified under penalty of perjury.
This bill would authorize, until January 1, 2022, the Beach Cities Health District and the Peninsula Health Care District to use the design-build process for the construction of facilities or other buildings in those districts, as specified. Because the bill would expand the application of the procurement process to additional design-build entities, the bill would expand the crime of perjury, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Beach Cities Health District and the Peninsula Health Care District.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.
(1)Under the existing Dental Practice Act, the Dental Board of California licenses and regulates the practice of dentistry. The act provides that an applicant may obtain an initial 2-year license to practice dentistry and a 2-year renewal license. The act also makes certain conduct unprofessional conduct and authorizes the board to revoke or suspend a license or reprimand or place on probation a dentist for that unprofessional conduct.
Under the existing Medical Practice Act, the Medical Board of California, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California, and the California Board of Podiatric Medicine establish requirements pursuant to which an applicant may obtain an initial 2-year license or subsequent 2-year renewal license to practice medicine as a podiatrist, as a physician and surgeon, osteopathic medicine as an osteopathic physician and surgeon, or podiatric medicine as a podiatrist, respectively. Under existing law, the Medical Board of California is required to adopt and administer standards for the continuing education of physicians and surgeons and each year audits a random sample of physicians and surgeons who have reported compliance with those requirements and requires a noncompliant licensee to make up the deficiency during the next renewal period. Under existing law, a licensee who fails to so comply is ineligible for a subsequent renewal license until he or she documents compliance to the board. Existing law provides for similar continuing education requirements as a condition of obtaining a renewal license to practice osteopathic medicine and podiatric medicine. The act authorizes these boards to discipline a licensee for specified unprofessional conduct.
This bill would require a “covered licensee,” defined as a dentist, physician and surgeon, osteopathic physician and surgeon, or person licensed to practice podiatric medicine, who practices in a setting other than a clinic, general acute care hospital, or skilled nursing facility, to adopt and implement an antimicrobial stewardship policy consistent with specified guidelines or methods of intervention, as defined, before applying for a renewal license and, upon applying for a renewal license, to certify in writing, on a form prescribed by the respective licensing board, that he or she has both adopted an antimicrobial stewardship policy and is in compliance with that policy. The bill would require those licensing boards to audit, during each year, a random sample of covered licensees who have certified compliance with these requirements and would limit the audit of an individual covered licensee to once every 4 years. The bill would require a covered licensee who is selected for audit to submit to the board, on a form prescribed by the board, a copy of his or her antimicrobial stewardship policy. The bill would require the respective licensing board, that determines that its audited covered licensee has failed to comply with these requirements, to require that covered licensee to comply with these requirements during the following renewal period. The bill would provide that the failure of a covered licensee to comply with those requirements during the renewal period constitutes unprofessional conduct.
(2)Under existing law, health facilities, including, among others, general acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, primary care clinics, and specialty clinics, are licensed and regulated by the State Department of Public Health, and a violation of those provisions is a crime. Existing law requires that each general acute care hospital, on or before July 1, 2015, adopt and implement an antimicrobial stewardship policy in accordance with guidelines established by the federal government and professional organizations that includes a process to evaluate the judicious use of antibiotics, as specified. Existing law requires each skilled nursing facility, on or before January 1, 2017, to adopt and implement an antimicrobial stewardship policy consistent with guidelines developed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other specified entities.
This bill would, beginning January 1, 2018, require a clinic to adopt and implement an antimicrobial stewardship policy consistent with specified guidelines or methods of intervention, as defined. Because this bill would create new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3)The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

Alquist Hospital Facilities Seismic Safety Act of 1983. The bill states that no reimbursement is required pursuant to this bill because it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction. The bill declares that it is necessary: (1) for the Beach Cities Health District and the Peninsula Health Care District to facilitate construction of facilities or other buildings in their districts at the earliest possible time pursuant to design-build authority, and (2) to ensure the provision of health care services in those districts at the earliest possible time."
"Existing law prohibits the acknowledgment of an instrument from being taken unless the officer taking it has “satisfactory evidence” that the person making the acknowledgment is the individual who is described in and who executed the instrument.

"Existing law provides that entry of judgment may be deferred with respect to a defendant who is charged with certain crimes involving possession of controlled substances, who pleads guilty to the charge or charges, and who meets certain criteria, including that he or she has no prior convictions for any offense involving controlled substances and has had no felony convictions within the 5 years prior, as specified. Existing law requires the criminal charge or charges to be dismissed if the defendant has performed satisfactorily in a specified program during the period in which deferred entry of judgment was granted.
This bill would authorize specified counties to establish a pilot program to operate a deferred entry of judgment pilot program for eligible defendants. The bill would authorize a defendant to participate in the program within the county’s juvenile hall if that person is charged with committing a felony offense, except as specified, he or she pleads guilty to the charge or charges, and the probation department determines that the person meets specified requirements, including that the defendant is 18 years of age or older, but under 21 years of age on the date the offense was committed, is suitable for the program, and shows the ability to benefit from services generally reserved for delinquents. The bill would require the probation department to develop a plan for reentry services.
The bill would require the court to grant deferred entry of judgment if the eligible defendant consents to participate in the program, waives his or her right to a speedy trial or a speedy preliminary hearing, pleads guilty to the charge or charges, and waives time for the pronouncement of judgment. The bill would also require the court to render a finding of guilt to the charge or charges pleaded, enter judgment, and schedule a sentencing hearing, and would require the return of the defendant to custody in a county jail if the court finds that the defendant is performing unsatisfactorily in the program or that the defendant is not benefiting from the services in the program. If the defendant has performed satisfactorily during the period in which deferred entry of judgment was granted, at the end of that period, the bill would require the court to dismiss the criminal charge or charges.
The bill would require a county, prior to establishing a pilot program, to apply to the Board of State and Community Corrections for approval of a county institution as a suitable place for confinement for the purpose of the pilot program. The bill would require the board to review and approve or deny the application of the county within 30 days of receiving notice of this proposed use. The bill would also require each county to establish a multidisciplinary team consisting of representatives of specified local entities. The team would be required to meet periodically to review and discuss the implementation, practices, and impact of the program.
The bill would require the probation department to submit data relating to the effectiveness of the program to the Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry, within the Department of Justice. The bill would prohibit a defendant participating in the program from coming into contact with minors within the juvenile hall, would prohibit a defendant from serving longer than one year in custody within a county’s juvenile hall pursuant to the program, and would require the board to review a county’s pilot program to ensure compliance with the federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as specified.
The bill would require a county that establishes a pilot program pursuant to these provisions to submit data regarding the pilot program to the board, and would require the board to conduct an evaluation of the pilot program’s impact and effectiveness, as specified. The bill would require the evaluation to be combined into a comprehensive report and submitted to the Assembly and Senate Committees on Public Safety. The bill would also authorize the board to contract with an independent entity, including, but not limited to, the Regents of the University of California, to carry out these duties.
The authority conferred by this bill would be repealed on January 1, 2020.

The bill would provide that the exemption does not apply if the project site is located in certain areas. The bill would require the LA-RICS Joint Powers Authority to hold a public meeting before making a determination that a project is exempted, to file the notice of exemption with the Office of Planning and Research and the county clerk in the county in which the project is located, and to post certain information on its Internet Web site. Because a lead agency, which may include a local agency, would be required to determine whether a project qualifies for this exemption and to perform additional duties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

"(1) Existing law authorizes the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to obtain day treatment, and to contract for crisis care services, for parolees with mental health problems, and requires the department to provide a supportive housing program that provides wraparound services to mentally ill parolees at risk of homelessness using funding appropriated for that purpose. Existing law provides that an inmate or parolee is eligible for participation if he or she has a serious mental disorder, as defined, has been assigned a release date from state prison, and is likely to become homeless upon release or is currently a homeless parolee. Existing law requires providers to offer various services, including housing location services and rental subsidies. Existing law requires a service provider to comply with specified requirements, including, among others, that the service provider has prior experience working with county or regional mental health programs.
This bill would require a service provider to also demonstrate an existing relationship with a supportive housing provider. The bill would specify that a program participant is not required to receive other services for mentally ill parolees as a condition of eligibility to receive rental assistance through the program.
The bill would require a service provider to exercise due diligence in providing any mental health or other contracted services and to notify the department of a participant’s participation in those services.
The bill would require a service provider to offer rental subsidies that are equal to or greater than fair market rent, as defined. The bill would also prohibit the department or a service provider from limiting the duration that a program participant may receive rental assistance through the program, except by the length of the person’s parole.
(2) Existing law requires a service provider to identify and locate supportive housing opportunities prior to a program participant’s release from state prison or as quickly upon release from state prison as possible, or as quickly as possible when a program participant is identified during parole. Existing law requires a service provider to report specified information to the department, including the number of program participants served and the outcomes for program participants, including the number of participants who returned to state prison.
This bill would require a service provider to identify and locate supportive housing opportunities no later than 9 months after the program participant has agreed to participate in the program. The bill would require that the housing located provide the program participant with a lease where he or she has all of the rights and responsibilities of tenancy. The bill would require a service provider to use a portion of the program payments received to provide interim housing, as defined. The bill would also require a service provider to report to the department the percentage of program participants currently living in permanent housing and the number who are arrested and residing in county jail.

It directs the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, pursuant to contracts entered into under the program, to provide supportive housing programs for parolees who suffer from mental illness and are either homeless or at risk of homelessness, in order to successfully reintegrate the parolees into the community, increase public safety, and reduce state costs of recidivism. &quot;Supportive housing&quot; means rental assistance paid to participating landlords while the service provider and program participant seek permanent rental assistance that allows the program participant to remain in the same housing or, when feasible, allows the program participant to incur the full responsibility of paying rent through employment or benefits entitlement once parole ends. Fair market rent means the rent, including the cost of utilities other than telephone, that must be paid in the market area to rent privately owned, existing, decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest nature with suitable amenities."
"(1) Existing law requires a pupil to be excused from school for specified types of absences and prohibits those excused absences from generating state apportionment payments by deeming them as absences in computing average daily attendance.

allow
adopt a policy that allows
a parenting pupil who gives or expects to give birth up to 6 weeks of parental leave and to allow a parenting pupil not giving birth up to 3 weeks of parental leave. The bill would specify that parental leave absences shall not be deemed absences in computing average daily attendance if the governing board of the school district of attendance files with the State Department of Education an expectant and parenting pupil policy that includes procedures for ensuring pupils are provided with schoolwork while on parental leave, and would specify the method for crediting average daily attendance for these pupils.
(2) Existing state regulations require an educational institution to treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery from those conditions in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability. Existing law requires a school district that receives notification of a pupil’s temporary disability to determine whether the pupil will be able to receive individualized instruction, and, if the determination is positive, to provide the individualized instruction, as specified.
This bill would require a school district to provide a pupil with a temporary disability as a result of pregnancy with guidelines for makeup work plan development if the option for individualized instruction is not available at the pupil’s school or school district.
(3) Existing law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, gender, or other specified characteristics in any program or activity conducted by an educational institution that receives, or benefits from, state financial assistance or enrolls pupils who receive state financial aid.
This bill would require a school district to notify pregnant and parenting pupils of specified rights and options available to those pupils, as specified.
(4) To the extent that this bill would impose additional duties on school districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(5) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill requires a school district in California to notify pregnant and parenting pupils their rights pursuant to title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972 through independent study packets, in the rigorous instruction of the school district's annual school year welcome packets, and in locker rooms. The bill also permits the governing board of a school district to allow bonding rooms to adopt a policy that allows bonding time up to six weeks in a year if the school district expects parental leave to exceed the length of time allowed under this bill.

"Existing law, as amended by Proposition 83 at the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, prohibits any person who is required to register pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act from residing within 2,000 feet of any public or private school, or park where children regularly gather.
This bill would require that the 2,000-foot residency restriction be measured by the shortest practical pedestrian or vehicle path. The bill would limit the residency restriction to persons convicted of specified offenses. The bill would clarify that the state parole authority shall enforce the residency restriction except under specified conditions. The bill would permit a person who is subject to the residency restriction to petition the superior court of the county within which he or she resides for relief from the requirement. The bill would provide that original jurisdiction for the petition would lie with the appellate division of the superior court in which the petition is filed. The bill would require the petitioner to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a pervasive lack of compliant housing in the county, that the petitioner is among a substantial proportion of sex offenders subject to the residency restriction who are unable to find compliant housing, and that the housing restriction is the principal reason that those without a residence have been unable to find housing. The bill would allow relief to modify the residential distance restrictions if that relief is narrowly crafted, and would allow the court to bifurcate the application of residency restrictions so as to apply discrete restrictions to those who have been convicted of child molestation or other felony sex offenses involving victims under 18 years of age. The bill would prohibit a subsequent petition from being heard if relief is granted or denied, unless the petitioner establishes in the petition, to the satisfaction of the court, that circumstances regarding compliant housing have changed, as provided.
Proposition 83 permits the Legislature, by a vote of
2/3
of the membership of each house and in accordance with specified procedures, to amend the provisions of the act.
By amending Proposition 83, this bill would require a
2/3

Specifies that nothing in this Act shall prohibit municipal jurisdictions from enacting local ordinances that further restrict the residency of any person for whom registration is required. Declares that any person prohibited from living within 2,000 feet of any public or private school, or park where children regularly gather, may seek relief from those restrictions if he or she cannot comply with the restriction because of the unavailability of compliant housing within his or her county of domicile.

The Public Utilities Act provides the commission with broad authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations, while local publicly owned electric utilities and electrical cooperatives are under the direction of their governing boards. Existing law establishes requirements for equipment, practices, and facilities for public utilities, including standards, enforceable by the commission, for installation and maintenance of wires or cables used to conduct electricity. Under existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.
This bill would require each electrical corporation, local publicly owned electric utility, and electrical cooperative to construct, maintain, and operate its electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by those electrical lines and equipment. The bill would require each electrical corporation to annually prepare a wildfire mitigation plan. The bill would require each electrical corporation to submit its plan to the commission for review, as specified. The bill would require the commission to review and comment on the submitted plan, as specified. The bill would require the governing board of a local publicly owned electric utility or electrical cooperative to determine whether any portion of the geographical area where the utility’s overhead electrical lines and equipment are located has a significant risk of catastrophic wildfire resulting from those electrical lines and equipment and, if so, would require the local publicly owned electric utility or electrical cooperative, at an interval determined by the board, to present to the board for its approval those wildfire mitigation measures the utility intends to undertake to minimize the risk of its overhead electrical lines and equipment causing a catastrophic wildfire. By placing additional duties upon local publicly owned electric utilities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. Because a violation of these provisions by an electrical corporation would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons.","This bill requires electrical corporations in California to construct, maintain, and operate their electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by those electrical lines and equipment. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall supervise an electrical corporation in California that is in compliance with this bill."
"Existing law establishes the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission to, among other things, maintain contact with state and municipal bond issuers, underwriters, investors, and credit rating agencies to improve the market for state and local government debt issues and to assist state and local governments to prepare, market, and sell their debt issues. Existing law requires the commission to collect, maintain, and provide comprehensive information on all state and all local debt authorization and issuance and to serve as a statistical clearinghouse for all state and local debt issuance.
This bill would additionally require the commission to track and report on all state and local outstanding debt until fully repaid or redeemed.
Existing law requires the issuer of debt of state or local government to submit reports to the commission, within specified timeframes, of the proposed issuance of debt and of final sale, as provided.
This bill would require that the report of proposed debt include a certification by the issuer that it has adopted local debt policies, which include specified provisions concerning the use of debt and that the contemplated debt issuance is consistent with those local debt policies.
This bill would also require a state or local public agency to submit an annual report for any issue of debt for which it has submitted a report of final sale on or after January 21, 2017. The bill would require the annual report to cover a reporting period of July 1 to June 30, inclusive, and to include specified information about debt issued and outstanding and the use of proceeds from debt during the reporting period. The bill would require that the report be submitted within 7 months after the end of the reporting period by any method approved by the commission. The bill would require the commission to consult with appropriate state and local debt issuers and organizations representing debt issuers prior to approving any annual method of reporting pursuant to these provisions, as provided.
This bill would make various findings and declarations regarding its provisions.","(Sec. 2) Establishes the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission, which shall: (1) assist state and local financing authorities and commissions in carrying out their responsibilities as prescribed by law, including assisting in protecting the issuer's credit; (2) maintain and provide comprehensive information on all state and local debt authorization and issuance, track and report on all outstanding debt until fully repaid or redeemed, and serve as a statistical clearinghouse for all state and local debt; (3) undertake changes in state laws and local practices to improve the sale and servicing of state and local debts, including recommending changes in state laws and local practices to reduce the cost of, and improve credit ratings of, such debts; (4) undertake studies on methods to reduce the costs and improve credit ratings of state and local debts; (5) assist local officials having direct supervisory responsibility over municipal investments and debt issuance; (6) establish a continuing education program for local officials having such responsibility; (7) undertake these and other activities to reduce cost and improve credit ratings of state and local debts; (8) maintain and provide comprehensive information on state and local debt authorization and issuance, track and report on all outstanding debt until fully repaid or redeemed; and (9) serve as a statistical clearinghouse for all state and local debt."
"Existing law requires the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to maintain quarantine inspection stations. Existing law requires that a sign be conspicuously posted at any inspection station maintained at or near the California border stating that the federal Gun Control Act of 1968 may prohibit persons from bringing firearms into the state that were acquired outside of the state.
The bill would require that these inspection station signs also state that California law may prohibit a person from bringing a firearm into the state that was acquired outside of the state.
Existing law prescribes the statute of limitations for filing various criminal complaints.
This bill would provide that, notwithstanding any other statute of limitation for filing a criminal complaint, the limitation of time would not commence until one year after discovery
of
of, but in no event later than 5 years after the commission of,
the violation for specified offense involving the transfer of firearms, including, among others, violating prohibitions against transferring a firearm to a person who is prohibited from possessing a firearm,
and
transferring
a firearm to a minor or
a handgun to a person under 21 years of
age, and failing to complete a firearm transfer through a firearms dealer as required.
age.
Existing law generally regulates the sale and transfer of firearms. Existing law requires a firearms transaction conducted by a firearms dealer to include, among other things, a background check of the purchaser, and certain personal information about the purchaser to be submitted to the department. Existing law requires a firearm transfer between 2 persons, neither of whom are a firearms dealer, to be conducted through a dealer. Similarly, existing law requires a person who imports or transports a firearm into this state that was obtained outside of the state to have the firearm delivered to a dealer for delivery to that person.
This bill would provide a return process for firearms obtained under the circumstances described above and in violation of the requirement that a firearms dealer conduct the transfer. The bill would require the owner of the firearm to deliver the firearm to a firearms dealer, who would report taking possession of the firearm to the department, and would require the firearm to be returned to the prior owner after a background check and other requirements that apply to a firearms transaction conducted by a dealer have been met. A violation of these provisions by a dealer would be a misdemeanor. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would make conforming changes to other provisions of law relating to records of firearms transactions kept by the department and a firearms dealer. The bill would, for firearms complying with those return provisions, make conforming changes to other provisions of law that provide exceptions from various prohibitions, including, among others, exceptions to the prohibition against carrying a concealed firearm, to the prohibition against openly carrying a firearm, and to carrying a firearm that is not a handgun in public. The bill would, for firearms returned pursuant to the return provisions, also make exceptions to other provisions of law requiring firearm safety devices, firearm safety certificates, and regulating unsafe handguns.
Existing law makes it a crime for a person, corporation, or firm to sell, loan, or transfer a firearm to a minor or sell a handgun to an individual under 21 years of age. Existing law makes it a crime for a firearms dealer to supply, deliver, or give possession or control of a handgun to any person under 21 years of age, or any other firearm to a person under 18 years of age. Existing law makes these crimes punishable as a misdemeanor, except that in the case of a handgun the crimes are punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony, as specified.
This bill would make these crimes punishable as a misdemeanor or felony, as specified, in the case of a centerfire semiautomatic rifle.
Existing law, subject to exceptions, requires a firearms dealer to comply with certain requirements when delivering a firearm to a person, including, among others, that the firearm is not delivered within 10 days of the application to purchase and is not delivered to a person that the Department of Justice has notified the dealer is prohibited from receiving a firearm. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a misdemeanor, except that in the case of a handgun the violation is a misdemeanor or a felony, as specified.
This bill would make a violation of those provisions, in the case of a centerfire semiautomatic rifle, punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony, as specified.
By creating new crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires reports of ownership be filed within certain grace periods for firearms brought or imported into the state by a personal firearms importer or licensed collector. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a misdemeanor.
This bill would make a violation of those provisions, in the case of a handgun, punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony.
By increasing the penalty for an existing offense, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would provide that the violations of failing to process a firearms transaction through a dealer when neither party to the transaction is a dealer, and of importing a firearm without it going to a dealer for delivery to the importer would not apply if the only evidence of the violation arises because of information supplied to the Department of Justice in connection with the return process described above.
Existing law prohibits a person, corporation, or dealer from acquiring a firearm for the purpose of selling, loaning, or transferring the firearm if the dealer has the intent to transfer the firearm to a minor or to evade specified requirements on the transfer of firearms, or in the case of a person, if the person intends to violate the requirement that the transaction be conducted through a licensed firearms dealer. A violation of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony.
This bill would similarly prohibit a person, corporation, or dealer from transporting a firearm or bringing a firearm into this state for the purpose of selling, loaning, or transferring the firearm with the intent specified above. By expanding the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Food and Agricultural Code to require the Director of the Bureau of Land Management to post at any inspection station maintained at or near the California border a conspicuous sign stating that if a person is a California resident and the Federal Gun Control Act may prohibit such person from bringing with him or her firearms outside of this state. (Currently, such prohibition does not apply to a person who is not a California resident.) Amends the federal criminal code to revise the prohibition against transferring firearms knowing that it will be used to commit a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime. Specifies that no time during which prosecution of the same person for a specified offense is part of a limitation of time prescribed for such offense. Extends such limitation from one to three years during which a defendant is not within the state. Prohibits commencing a prosecution under this Act until the offense has been discovered, or could have reasonably been discovered, while under 18 years of age. Authorizes a criminal complaint to be filed within one year of the date of a report to a California law enforcement agency by a person of any age alleging that he or she,"
"Existing law prohibits a person from being employed by a community college in an academic or classified position unless the person has submitted to a tuberculosis examination within the past 60 days to determine that he or she is free of active tuberculosis.
This bill would instead prohibit employment unless the person, within 60 days, has submitted to a tuberculosis risk assessment and, if tuberculosis risk factors are identified, has undergone a tuberculosis examination.","Provides that a person shall not be initially employed by a community college district in an academic or classified position unless the person has within the last 60 days submitted to a tuberculosis risk assessment developed by the State Department of Public Health and the California Tuberculosis Controllers Association and, if risk factors are present, an examination to determine that he or she is free of active tuberculosis by a physician and surgeon licensed under the Business and Professions Code or a physician assistant practicing in compliance with Chapter 7.7. Specifies that the examination shall consist of an approved intra tuberculin test or any other test for tuberculosis infection recommended by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and licensed by the Federal Food and Drug Administration that, if positive, shall be followed by an X-ray of the lungs. Permits the district superintendent, or his or her designee, to exempt, for up to 60 days following termination of the pregnancy, a pregnant employee from the requirement that a positive intrarculin test be followed by an X-ray of the lungs. Specifies that thereafter, employees who are skin test negative, or negative by any other test recommended by the CDC and licensed by the FDA, or were not tested because of a lack of risk factors, shall be required to undergo the foregoing tuberculosis risk assessment"
"Existing law authorizes the City and County of San Francisco (San Francisco) to enforce parking violations in specified transit-only traffic lanes through the use of video imaging, and authorizes San Francisco to install automated forward facing parking control devices on city-owned public transit vehicles for the purpose of video imaging parking violations occurring in transit-only traffic lanes. Existing law requires a designated employee, who is qualified by San Francisco, to review video image recordings for the purpose of determining whether a parking violation occurred in a transit-only traffic lane, and to issue a notice of parking violation to a registered owner of a vehicle within 15 calendar days of the date of the violation. Existing laws makes these video image records confidential, and provides that these records are available only to public agencies to enforce parking violations. Existing law establishes the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District.
This bill would extend the provisions to the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, thereby authorizing the district to enforce parking violations in specified transit-only traffic lanes through the use of video imaging evidence and to install automated forward facing parking control devices on district-owned public transit vehicles. The bill would repeal the authority for the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District to implement an automated enforcement system to enforce parking violations occurring in transit-only traffic lanes on January 1, 2022.
This bill would require, under designated circumstances, the district and the City and County of San Francisco to submit to the transportation, privacy, and judiciary committees of the Legislature evaluations of the automated enforcement system’s effectiveness, impact on privacy, cost to implement, and generation of revenue, no later than January 1, 2021.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City and County of San Francisco and the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","This bill authorizes the city of San Francisco and the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District to install automated forward facing parking control devices on city-owned or district-owned public transit vehicles to capture video imaging of parking violations occurring in transit-only traffic lanes. The devices shall record the date and time of the violation at the same time as the video images are captured. Prior to issuing notices of parking violations, the city and county shall commence a program to issue only warning notices. The city and county shall also make a public announcement of the program at least 30 days prior to commencement of issuing notices. A designated employee of the city and county or the district, who is qualified by the city and county or the district to issue parking citations, shall review video image recordings for the purpose of determining whether a parking violation occurred in a transit-only traffic lane. A violation of a statute, regulation, or ordinance governing vehicle parking under this code, under a federal or state statute or regulation, or under an ordinance enacted by the city and county or the transit district occurring in a transit-only traffic lane observed by the designated employee in the recordings is subject to a civil penalty. The registered owner shall be permitted to review the video image evidence of the alleged violation during normal business hours at no"
"Existing law generally prohibits housing discrimination with respect to various personal characteristics including source of income. Existing law defines “source of income” for these purposes as lawful, verifiable income paid directly to a tenant or paid to a representative of a tenant, which does not include a landlord.
This bill would amend the definition of “source of income” to also include specified federal, state, or local housing assistance or subsidies paid either to the tenant or directly to the landlord on behalf of the tenant.
Existing law permits a person who holds an ownership interest of record in property that he or she believes is the subject of an unlawfully restrictive covenant based on, among other things, source of income, to record a Restrictive Covenant Modification, which is to include a copy of the original document with the illegal language stricken. Before recording the modification document, existing law requires the county recorder to submit the modification document and the original document to the county counsel who is required to determine whether the original document contains an unlawful restriction.
This bill, by revising the definition of source of income, would increase the requirements on a county counsel to determine if there exists an unlawfully restrictive covenant based on source of income, as described above. By creating new duties for county counsels, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(Sec. 1) Makes it unlawful for any owner of any housing accommodation to: (1) refuse to rent or lease a portion of an owner-occupied single-family house to a person living within the household, provided that no more than one roomer or boarder is to live within the household and the owner complies with a specified subdivision of the Government Code prohibiting discriminatory notices, statements, and advertisements; or (2) imply that housing being advertised is available only to persons of one sex. Excludes from the definition of discriminatory notice, statements, and advertisements the use of words stating or tending to imply that the housing being advertised is available only to persons of one sex. Includes within the definition of discriminatory housing practice: (1) the making or purchasing of loans or providing other financial assistance for the purpose of purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling, or that is secured by residential real property; (2) the selling, brokering, or appraising of residential real property; and (3) the use of territorial underwriting requirements, for the purpose of requiring a borrower in a specific geographic area to obtain earthquake insurance, required by an institutional third party on a loan secured by residential real property.

"Existing law provides that every person has, subject to the qualifications and restrictions provided by law, the right of protection from bodily harm, and from injury to his or her personal relations. Existing law authorizes the California Victim Compensation and Government Claims Board to compensate a victim of a crime from the Restitution Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, for pecuniary loss incurred as a direct result of the crime, when the board determines it will best aid the person seeking compensation.
This bill would authorize a person who is injured by an act of terrorism, as defined, to bring an action to recover damages against a person or entity who committed the act of terrorism, aided the person or entity to commit the act or terrorism, or coerced, induced, or solicited the person or entity to commit the act of terrorism. The bill would provide that the amount awarded may be up to 3 times the damages actually incurred, but in no event less than $10,000. The bill would permit a civil action or proceeding under this section to be commenced at any time within 5 years after the injury caused by the act of terrorism is suffered, as specified.","Amends the Civil Code to allow a person who is injured by an act of terrorism to recover damages against: (1) a person or entity who committed such act; (2) a person or entity who aided the person or entity in committing such act; or (3) a person or entity who coerced, induced, or solicited such person or entity in committing such act. Allows: (1) the amount awarded to be up to three times the damages actually incurred, but in no event less than $10,000; and (2) the plaintiff to be awarded reasonable attorney's fees and costs of investigation and litigation.Permits commencement of a civil action or proceeding under this Act at any time within five years after the injury caused by such an act. Provides that if a criminal prosecution proceeds against a person or entity who committed an act of terrorism, aided the person or entity in committing such act, or coerced, induced, or solicited such person or entity in committing such act, the time for commencing suit shall be tolled during the pendency of that criminal prosecution."
"Title 38 of the United States Code provides educational awards for eligible active duty members and veterans of the Armed Forces of the United States. Existing law requires an institution headquartered or operating in California desiring to enroll students eligible for federal Title 38 awards in accredited courses to make application for approval of these courses to the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education, commonly known as CSAAVE, and authorizes CSAAVE to approve the application of the school when the school and its accredited courses satisfy the specified criteria and any additional reasonable criteria established by CSAAVE.
This bill would include as a qualifying institution for federal Title 38 awards, an institution that has been accredited by the Committee of Bar Examiners, if the institution complies with specified disclosure and compliance requirements.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 19, 2015. (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to revise requirements for the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education (CSAAVE) to approve the application of institutions of higher education (IHEs) and programs offering courses eligible for veterans' education awards if such IHEs and programs: (1) are accredited by the Department of Education, (2) comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, and (3) provide information on where to access California license examination passage rates for the most recent available year from graduates of their undergraduate programs leading to employment for which passage of a California licensing examination is required. The bill defines &quot;CSAAVE&quot; as the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education, legally designated pursuant to specified federal regulations, that requires an IHE to enroll veterans or persons eligible for veterans' education awards in IHEs and programs to make application for approval of these courses to the agency. The bill states that it is reasonable pursuant to such requirements to require a postsecondary educational institution, public or private, to obtain accreditation for its degree programs. It is reasonable pursuant to such requirements to require a private postsecondary institution to be issued an approval to"
"Existing law prohibits an employer from paying any of its employees at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort, and responsibility, and performed under similar working conditions, unless the employer demonstrates that specific, reasonably applied factors account for the entire wage differential. Existing law authorizes an employee paid lesser wages in violation of this prohibition to file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, and authorizes the employee, the division, or the Department of Industrial Relations to commence a civil action for the wages the employee was deprived of because of the violation, interest on those wages, and liquidated damages. Under existing law, an employer or other person who violates or causes a violation of that prohibition, or who reduces the wages of any employee in order to comply with that prohibition, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
This bill would also prohibit an employer from paying any of its employees at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of another race or ethnicity for substantially similar work, as specified above. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would incorporate additional changes in Section 1197.5 of the Labor Code proposed by AB 1676 that would become operative only if AB 1676 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003.

"Existing law, until January 1, 2017, authorizes the Counties of Alameda and Los Angeles, respectively, to create a pilot project, contingent upon local funding, for the purposes of developing a comprehensive, replicative, multidisciplinary model to address the needs and effective treatment of commercially sexually exploited minors, as specified.
This bill would extend the operation of this program indefinitely in the County of Alameda. The bill would also expand the definition of a “commercially sexually exploited minor” to include, among others, a minor who has been adjudged a dependent of the juvenile court because he or she is a commercially sexually exploited child, and would create a presumption that, if a minor has been arrested for engaging in prostitution, or is the subject of a petition to adjudge him or her a dependent of the juvenile court because he or she is a commercially sexually exploited child, he or she is a commercially sexually exploited minor for the purposes of that definition.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Alameda.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 17, 2016.

"Existing law establishes the state transportation improvement program process, pursuant to which the California Transportation Commission programs, on a biennial basis, available state and federal funds for transportation capital improvement projects, other than state highway rehabilitation and repair projects, for the 5-year period of the state transportation improvement program, based on the interregional transportation improvement program prepared by the Department of Transportation and the regional transportation improvement programs prepared by regional transportation planning agencies. Existing law requires the Department of Transportation to submit to the California Transportation Commission an estimate of state and federal funds reasonably expected to be available for future programming over the 5-year period in each state transportation improvement program, and requires the California Transportation Commission to adopt a fund estimate in that regard.
This bill would require the fund estimates prepared by the department and the commission to identify and include federal funds derived from apportionments made to the state under the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation

Act of 2015.
Existing law prohibits a person who has 0.08% or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood from driving a vehicle. Existing law also prohibits a person while having 0.08% or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood from driving a vehicle and concurrently doing any act forbidden by law, or neglecting any duty imposed by law in driving the vehicle, when the act or neglect proximately causes bodily injury to a person other than the driver. A violation of either of these prohibitions is a crime. Existing law authorizes a court, in addition to imposing penalties and sanctions for those violations, to require the person to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a driving-under-the-influence program, which may include, among other things, education, group counseling, and individual interview sessions.
Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to immediately suspend a person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle for a specified period of time if the person has driven a motor vehicle when the person had a certain blood-alcohol concentration. Existing law also requires the department to suspend or revoke the driving privilege of a person who refuses an officer’s request or fails to complete a chemical test or tests, as specified. Existing law authorizes certain individuals whose privilege is suspended or revoked pursuant to that provision to receive a restricted driver’s license if specified requirements are met, including the completion of specified periods of license suspension or revocation and, in some instances, the installation of an ignition interlock device on the person’s vehicle.
This bill would authorize the court to order a person convicted of a crime described above to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a qualified “24/7 Sobriety program,” as defined, as a condition of probation, if the program is available and deemed appropriate, and the person committed the crime within 10 years of one or more separate crimes described above that resulted in a conviction. The bill also would authorize a court to order participation in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of release on bond for a person who has been charged with a crime described above, as specified. The bill would permit a person whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked for certain violations, and who subsequently applies to the department for a restricted driving privilege, to be permitted to participate in a 24/7 Sobriety program for a minimum of one year as a condition of obtaining the restricted driving privilege as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, participation in an ignition interlock device program. The bill would define a “24/7 Sobriety program,” in part, as requiring a person in the program to abstain from alcohol and unauthorized controlled substances and be subject to frequent testing for alcohol and controlled substances, as specified. The bill would require a person participating in the program to pay the program costs, commensurate with the person’s ability to pay, as specified. The bill would make related legislative findings and declarations and state the intent of the Legislature to enact these provisions for the purpose of making the state eligible to receive grant funding under the FAST Act and additional funding from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.","This bill declares that the intent of the state of California is to authorize a statewide 24/7 Sobriety program so that California is eligible for the new 24/7 FAST Act grant funding and additional funding available through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). A &quot;24/7 Sobriety program&quot; is a state law or program that authorizes a state court or agency with jurisdiction to require an individual who has committed a driving-under-the-influence offense to abstain from alcohol or controlled substances for a period of time and be subject to testing for alcohol or controlled substances at least twice per day at a testing location, or by a continuous trans monitoring device. These programs typically approach impaired driving deterrence by focusing on the most high-risk offenders, requiring abstinence from alcohol or illegal drugs, testing compliance multiple times per day, and swiftly delivering defined consequences for noncompliance."
"Existing law requires the county superintendent of schools, the superintendent of a school district, or the owner or operator of a private school that provides transportation to or from a school or school activity to prepare a transportation safety plan containing procedures for school personnel to follow to ensure the safe transport of pupils, as prescribed.
This bill would require that plan to include procedures to ensure that a pupil is not left unattended on a schoolbus, school pupil activity bus, or youth bus, and procedures and standards for designating an adult chaperone, other than the driver, to accompany pupils on a school pupil activity bus. The bill would additionally require a charter school to prepare this plan.
Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district to contract for the transportation of pupils attending schools within the district, as specified.
This bill would require the governing board of a school district to require that any contract for the transportation of pupils includes the requirement that a pupil shall not be left unattended on a schoolbus, school pupil activity bus, or youth bus, as provided.
Existing law requires applicants seeking to renew a certificate to drive a schoolbus or a school pupil activity bus to complete classroom instruction and training, as specified.
This bill would require that classroom instruction to also cover the inspection procedures to ensure pupils are not left unattended on a schoolbus or school pupil activity bus.
Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to refuse to issue or renew, and to revoke or suspend, a schoolbus, school pupil activity bus, or youth bus driver certificate under certain, listed conditions.
This bill would require certain school officials to notify the department when a driver of such a bus has left a pupil unattended onboard after a specified school entity or the driver’s employer has ordered and upheld disciplinary action against the driver for the driver’s actions and has made a finding that the driver’s actions constituted gross negligence, as defined. The bill would authorize the department to refuse to issue or renew, and to revoke or suspend, a bus driver certificate on these grounds. The bill would permit a former applicant or holder of a certificate whose certificate was revoked pursuant to these provisions to reapply for a certificate if the certificate revocation is reversed or dismissed by the department.
Existing law requires all schoolbuses to be equipped with certain safety features, as specified.
This bill would require, on or before the beginning of the 2018–19 school year, schoolbuses, school pupil activity buses, except as provided, youth buses, and child care motor vehicles to be equipped with a “child safety alert system,” which is a device located at the interior rear of a vehicle that requires the driver to either manually contact or scan the device before exiting the vehicle, thereby prompting the driver to inspect the entirety of the interior of the vehicle before exiting.
Because a violation of the above requirement would be a Vehicle Code infraction, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating new crimes.

"The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law, including certain credits that are allowed in modified conformity to credits allowed by federal income tax laws. Federal income tax laws allow a refundable earned income tax credit for certain low-income individuals who have earned income from specified sources and who meet certain other requirements.
The Personal Income Tax Law, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, allows an earned income credit against personal income tax, and a payment from the Tax Relief and Refund Account for an allowable credit in excess of tax liability, to an eligible individual in an amount determined in accordance with federal law as applicable for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year, multiplied by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor, as specified. Existing law creates the Tax Relief and Refund Account, which is continuously appropriated, and provides that required payments to be made to taxpayers or other persons from the Personal Income Tax Fund are to be paid from that account, including amounts allowable as an earned income credit in excess of any tax liability. The Personal Income Tax Law provides that the amount of the credit is calculated as a percentage of the eligible individual’s earned income and is phased out above a specified amount as income increases. Under existing law, the credit percentage and the phaseout percentage is based on the number of qualifying children of the eligible individual. Existing law provides, in modified conformity with federal income tax law, in the case of an eligible individual with 3 or more qualifying children, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2016, the credit percentage and phaseout percentage is 45%, and for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, the credit percentage and phaseout percentage is the same as for an eligible individual with 2 or more children, which is 40%.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016, would instead provide that, in the case of an eligible individual with 3 or more qualifying children, the credit percentage and phaseout percentage is 45%, thereby increasing the credit percentage and the phaseout percentage for those eligible individuals for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
By increasing the allowable credit amount, this bill would authorize new payments from the Tax Relief and Refund Account for additional amounts in excess of personal income tax liabilities, thereby making an appropriation.",". The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to allow, beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a refundable income tax credit equal to 35% of earned income, subject to a phaseout percentage based on the number of qualifying children. The earned income tax credit authorized by this Act shall be operative for taxable years for which resources are authorized in the annual Budget Act to oversee and audit returns associated with the credit. The earned income tax credit authorized by this Act, relating to percentages, shall be determined in the same amount as the earned income tax credit adjustment factor for the taxable year, except as otherwise provided in this Act. The amount of the credit, relating to earned income, shall be multiplied by the earned income credit adjustment factor for the taxable year. Unless otherwise specified in the annual Budget Act, the earned income tax credit adjustment factor for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2015, shall be 0%."

Existing law authorizes the department to issue a special permit authorizing a health facility to offer one or more special services when specified requirements are met. Existing law requires general acute care hospitals to apply for supplemental services approval and requires the department, upon issuance and renewal of a license for certain health facilities, to separately identify on the license each supplemental service.
This bill would require a general acute care hospital that provides observation services, as defined, to comply with the same licensed nurse-to-patient ratios as supplemental emergency services, as specified. The bill would require that a patient receiving observation services receive written notice, as prescribed, that his or her care is being provided on an outpatient basis, which may affect the patient’s health coverage reimbursement. The bill would require observation units to be identified with specified signage, and would clarify that a general acute care hospital providing services described in the bill would not be exempt from these requirements because the hospital identifies those services by a name or term other than that used in the bill. Because a violation of these provisions by a health facility would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law, the Health Data and Advisory Council Consolidation Act, requires every organization that operates, conducts, or maintains a health facility to make and file with the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) specified reports containing various financial and patient data. Existing law requires OSHPD to maintain a file of those reports in its Sacramento office and to compile and publish summaries of individual facility and aggregate data that do not contain patient-specific information for the purpose of public disclosure.
This bill would require OSHPD to include summaries of observation services data, upon request, in the data summaries maintained by OSHPD under the act.

This bill, in a consumer arbitration case, would also require the disclosure of any solicitation made within the last 2 years by, or at the direction of, a private arbitration company to a party or lawyer for a party. The bill would only require disclosure of solicitations made after January 1, 2017. The bill would specify what is, and what is not, a solicitation for purposes of this disclosure. The bill would prohibit the solicitation of a party or lawyer for a party during the pendency of the arbitration. The bill would also prohibit an arbitrator, from the time of appointment until the conclusion of the arbitration, from entertaining or accepting any offers of employment or offers of new professional relationships, and, in a consumer arbitration case, would prohibit the arbitrator from entertaining or accepting any offers of employment as a dispute resolution neutral in another case from a party or lawyer for a party in the pending arbitration, except as provided.
This bill would exempt specified self-regulatory organizations from the application of the bill. The bill would provide that its provisions are severable.","This bill amends the Code of Civil Procedure to prohibit an arbitrator from receiving or accepting: any offers of employment or new professional relationships as a lawyer, expert witness, or consultant from a party or lawyer for a party in pending arbitration; or any offers of employment as a dispute resolution neutral in another case involving a party or lawyer for a party in pending arbitration unless all parties to the arbitration, including the lawyers in the arbitration, have conferred and agreed in writing, before any solicitation of the arbitrator, to allow offers of future employment as a dispute resolution neutral to be made to the arbitrator. The bill does not apply to an arbitration conducted or administered by a self-regulatory organization or regulations adopted under that Act. In any arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement, when a person is to serve as a neutral arbitrator, the proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be impartial, including: the existence of any ground specified for disqualification of a judge; whether or not the proposed neutral arbitrator has a current arrangement concerning prospective employment or other compensated service as a dispute resolution neutral or is participating in, or has participated in, discussions regarding such prospective employment or service with a party to the proceeding; any"

Existing law requires these fees to be adjusted annually according to a specified index.
Under existing law, the department issues tags, validations, and other entitlements upon payment of specified fees that are required in addition to a valid hunting license to take specified birds and mammals for purposes other than commercial purposes.

Existing law subjects these certificates and licenses to renewal and requires the holder of the certificate or license to apply for renewal on a form prescribed by the board and pay a prescribed fee, as provided.
This bill would additionally require an applicant for renewal to complete a board-administered online assessment to reinforce the certificate holder’s or licenseholder’s knowledge of laws applicable to his or her practice area.

The bill would also require the department to oversee the disciplinary actions of certifying organizations it approves, as provided.","This bill establishes the Alcohol and Drug Counseling Professional Bureau within the Department of Consumer Affairs. The duties of enforcing and administering this bill may be vested in the chief of the bureau and the chief serves at the pleasure director.

"(1) Existing law authorizes a city, county, or city and county to impose a tax on the privilege of occupying a room or other living space in a hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, or other lodging unless the occupancy is for a period of more than 30 days.
This bill, on and after July 1, 2017, would require every platform, as defined, that elects to assume the responsibility of collecting and remitting transient occupancy taxes on behalf of an operator to collect and remit the amount of the tax levied on a rental transaction facilitated by the platform for a unit that is offered for tourist or transient use and is located within a city, county, or city and county that has not elected to retain the responsibility for directly collecting the tax from operators, as specified. The bill would authorize a platform to make its election to assume responsibility, and a city, county, or city and county to make its election to retain responsibility, by notifying the Controller of the election on or before April 30, 2017. The bill would authorize a platform that does not make its election by April 30, 2017, to elect to assume responsibility by notifying the Controller on or after July 1, 2017, and would make this election effective 6 months after the Controller’s receipt of the notification or on the date specified in the notice, whichever is later. The bill would authorize a platform to discontinue an election, and a city, county, or city and county to make or discontinue an election, by notifying the Controller on or before June 30, 2019, or June 30 of any odd-numbered year thereafter, and would make this discontinuance or election effective on July 1, 2020, or July 1 of the first even-numbered year after notification.
This bill, commencing on January 1, 2017, and by December 31 of each year thereafter, would require the Controller to review or audit a platform’s collection and remittance of tax revenue pursuant to the bill and would prohibit the Controller or any person who obtains access to information contained in, or derived from, the review or audit to disclose information pertaining to any platform or other person required to provide information subject to audit or review, as specified. The bill would provide that a platform and a city, county, or city and county that, on or before June 1, 2016, have entered into a binding legal agreement relating to the collection of transient occupancy taxes are bound by the agreement and are required to notify the Controller of the agreement, that any election made to the Controller by the platform or the city, county, or city and county is not effective as to any other party to the agreement, and that the platform’s collection and remittance of transient occupancy taxes pursuant to the agreement are not subject to audit or review by the Controller pursuant to the bill, unless the platform and the city, county, and city and county mutually agree to terminate the agreement.
(2) The California Constitution authorizes a city or county to make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.
This bill would find and declare that providing short-term rental online platforms with uniform transient occupancy tax administration requirements is a matter of statewide concern, and that the bill therefore applies to charter cities, charter counties, and charter cities and counties.
(3) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
(4) The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
Existing law requires the governing body of each public agency, as defined, within 70 days after the commencement of its legal existence, to file, with the Secretary of State and the county clerk of each county in which the public agency maintains an office, a statement containing specified information about the public agency and its governing board and officers. Existing law requires, within 10 days after any change in that information, an amended statement to be filed.
This bill instead would require the statement to be filed within 50 working days after the date of commencement of an agency legal existence and would require an amended statement to be filed within 10 working days after any change in the information.",". The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.) (Sec. 3) This bill provides statutory procedures for a city or county in California to use certain online platforms to collect and remit local sales tax. In addition, the bill allows a city or county to elect to discontinue the use of certain existing platforms after June 30, 2017, or to elect to continue to use them, under specified conditions. The bill defines: &quot;Platform&quot; as a marketplace that is created for tourist or transient use; &quot; Rental unit&quot; as a unit offered for occupancy in a transient subdivision; and &quot;Platform operator&quot; as a person offering, through a platform, to make transient rental units available for occupancy, rather than having a platform collect and remit the tax on such an operator's rental unit. The administrative cost of using a platform to collect and remit the tax shall be the same as the administrative cost of using a platform to collect and remit the tax, unless the operator opts out. The bill also specifies that the administrative cost of using a platform to collect and remit the tax shall be the same as the administrative cost of using a platform to collect and remit the tax, unless the operator opts out."
"The Personal Income Tax Law authorizes various credits against the taxes imposed by that law, including a credit for qualified renters in the amount of $120 for married couples filing joint returns, heads of household, and surviving spouses if adjusted gross income is $50,000, as adjusted currently to $76,518, or less, and in the amount of $60 for other individuals if adjusted gross income is $25,000, as adjusted currently to $38,259, or less.

"Existing law prohibits a person who has been convicted of a felony involving bribery, embezzlement of public money, extortion or theft of public money, perjury, or conspiracy to commit any of those crimes, from being considered a candidate for, or elected to, a state or local elective office. Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, provides that campaign funds under the control of a former candidate or elected officer are considered surplus campaign funds at a prescribed time, and it prohibits the use of surplus campaign funds except for specified purposes.
This bill would prohibit an officeholder who is convicted of one of those enumerated felonies from using funds held by that officeholder’s candidate controlled committee for purposes other than certain purposes permitted for the use of surplus campaign funds. The bill would also require the officeholder to forfeit any remaining funds held 6 months after the conviction became final, and it would direct those funds to be deposited in the General Fund.
The Political Reform Act of 1974 prohibits a public officer from expending, and a candidate from accepting, public moneys for the purpose of seeking elective office.
This bill would permit a public officer or candidate to expend or accept public moneys for the purpose of seeking elective office if the state or a local governmental entity established a dedicated fund for this purpose, as specified.
A violation of the act’s provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.","This bill amends the government code to allow an officeholder who is convicted of a felony to use public funds held by the officeholder's candidate controlled committee only for: the payment of outstanding campaign debts or elected officer expenses; and the repayment of contributions of outstanding campaign debts or elected officer expenses, if the state or local governmental entity establishes a dedicated fund for such purpose by statute, ordinance, resolution, or charter."
"Existing law authorizes a county board of supervisors to appoint a committee, composed of county residents, to study the matter of changing the boundaries of its supervisorial districts. Existing law directs a committee created pursuant to that provision to report its findings to the board of supervisors, as specified, and it expressly states that recommendations of the committee are advisory only. Existing law similarly authorizes a city council to appoint a committee, composed of city residents, to study the matter of changing the boundaries of its council districts, directs a committee so created to report its findings to the city council, and expressly states that recommendations of the committee are advisory only.
This bill would delete those provisions and instead authorize a county or general law city to establish a commission, composed of residents of the county or city, to either change the boundaries of the districts or recommend to the governing body changes to the boundaries of the districts. The bill would also require an advisory commission that recommends changes to district boundaries to report to the governing body its findings on the need for changes to the boundaries. For a commission empowered to change district boundaries, this bill would prohibit the appointment of a person or family member, as defined, of a person who engaged in specified activities during the preceding 8 years, and it would also prohibit commission members from engaging in specified activities while serving and for a specified period of time after serving.","Repeals provisions of the California Election Code, with respect to requirements for independent redistricting commissions. Applies such provisions to independent redistricting commissions established by a local jurisdiction. Provides that: (1) a person who is an elected official of the local jurisdiction, or a family member, staff member, or paid campaign staff of such official, shall not be appointed to serve on such commission; and (2) such commission shall submit a report to the legislative body of its findings on the need for changes, and its recommended changes, within six months after the final population figures determined in each federal decennial census have been released, but in any event not later than August 1 of the year following the year following the year in which the census is taken. Authorizes the local jurisdiction to prescribe the manner in which members are appointed, provided that the jurisdiction uses an application process open to all eligible residents. Allows such jurisdiction to impose additional qualifications and restrictions on members in excess of those prescribed by this Act."
"Existing law authorizes a county to establish a pretrial diversion program for defendants who have been charged with a misdemeanor offense and authorizes other diversion programs, including for defendants with cognitive developmental disabilities, defendants in nonviolent drug cases, and traffic violations.
This bill would require the Board of State and Community Corrections to approve three counties for the establishment of a Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) pilot program. The bill would require the LEAD pilot programs to authorize designated officers to take a person for whom the officer has probable cause for arrest for specified controlled substances offenses, including possession of a controlled substance or other prohibited substance, or prostitution, to treatment programs and services in lieu of that arrest.
This bill, until January 1, 2020, would establish the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) pilot program, to be administered by the Board of State and Community Corrections, to improve public safety and reduce recidivism by increasing the availability and use of social service resources while reducing costs to law enforcement agencies and courts stemming from repeated incarceration. The bill would require the board to award grants, on a competitive basis, to up to 3 jurisdictions to establish LEAD programs and would require the board to establish minimum standards, funding schedules, and procedures for awarding grants. The bill would establish requirements for referral of people who may be arrested for, or who have a history of, low-level drug offenses or prostitution, as defined, to social services in lieu of prosecution. The bill would require the board to contract with a nonprofit research entity, university, or college to evaluate the effectiveness of the LEAD program and submit a report of the findings to the Governor and the Legislature by January 1, 2020.","Establishes the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) pilot program under which the Board of State and Community Corrections shall award grants, on a competitive basis, to up to three jurisdictions to be administered by the Board. <n>Directs the board to establish minimum standards, funding schedules, and procedures for awarding grants, which shall take into consideration: (1) information from the applicant demonstrating a clear understanding of the program's purpose and the applicant's willingness and ability to implement the LEAD program; (2) key local partners who would be committed to, and involved in, the development and successful implementation of a LEAD program; and (3) the jurisdiction's capacity and commitment to coordinate social services, law enforcement efforts, and justice system decision making processes and to work to ensure that the discretionary decisions made by each participant in the administration of the program operate in a manner consistent with the purposes of this Act. <n>Requires successful grant applicants to collect and maintain data pertaining to the effectiveness of the program as indicated by the board in the request for proposals. <n>Authorizes, as an alternative to immediate crisis services, a law enforcement officer to take or refer a person for whom the officer has probable cause for arrest for any of specified offenses to a case manager to schedule a complete assessment interview.

"Existing law vests control of the state park system with the Department of Parks and Recreation and authorizes the department to enter into an operating agreement with a qualified nonprofit organization for the development, improvement, restoration, care, maintenance, administration, or operation of a unit or units, or portion of a unit, of the state park system, subject to certain conditions and requirements.
This bill would repeal those provisions on January 1, 2025. The bill would also provide that an operating agreement may not eliminate jobs maintained under a memorandum of understanding.
This bill would authorize the department to enter into a statewide agreement with a park support organization, as defined, to facilitate the implementation of reforms recommended by the Parks Forward Commission and to develop and secure expertise, services, resources, and projects that are not readily available to the state park system for specified purposes relating to the funding, visitation, use, facilities, and staffing of state parks, as provided. The bill would require the department to take specified actions relating to the development and implementation of such an agreement and would authorize the Director of Parks and Recreation and the Director of Finance, or their designees, to serve as ex officio, nonvoting members of the park support organization’s board of directors. The bill would require the department, if it enters into an agreement with a park support organization, to collaborate with the park support organization to develop an annual list of strategic initiatives and projects that are statewide priorities for the state park system and the park support organization and that the park support organization will undertake in partnership with the department. The bill would authorize the department to enter into supplementary agreements and leases, as provided, with the park support organization and receive donations of projects, services, and funds to be used for the support of the state park system, subject to the review and approval of the statewide agreement or substantial amendment of such an agreement by the Director of Finance.
Existing law authorizes the department to lease, for any use, all or any portion of any parcel of real property acquired for state park system purposes, if the director finds that the use would be compatible with the use of the real property as a unit or part of a unit and with the sound management and conservation of resources within the unit, but prohibits the department from entering into a lease that extends beyond 10 years unless certain conditions for the review and approval of a proposed lease as part of the annual budget process are met. Existing law imposes similar review and approval requirements of operating leases or agreements that are expected to generate over $500,000 in annual gross revenues.
This bill would revise certain of those conditions for the review and approval of a proposed lease or operating lease or agreement by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, as specified. The bill would make those conditions applicable only to operating leases or agreements that are expected to generate over $1,000,000 in annual gross revenues.","Amends the Public Resources Code to authorize the Department of Parks and Recreation to enter into a statewide agreement with a park support organization to facilitate the implementation of reforms recommended by the Parks Forward Commission and to develop and secure expertise, services resources, and projects that are not readily available to the state park system.

"Existing law requires school districts, county offices of education, and special education local plan areas (SELPAs) to comply with state laws that conform to the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, in order that the state may qualify for federal funds available for the education of individuals with exceptional needs. Existing law requires school districts, county offices of education, and SELPAs to identify, locate, and assess individuals with exceptional needs and to provide those pupils with a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment, and with special education and related services, including mental health services, as reflected in an individualized education program.
Existing law contains provisions governing the operation and financing of community mental health services for the mentally disordered in every county through locally administered and locally controlled community mental health programs.
This bill would specifically authorize a county, or a qualified provider operating as part of the county mental health plan network, and a local educational agency to enter into a partnership that includes, among other things, an agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency that establishes a Medi-Cal mental health provider that is county operated or county contracted for the provision of mental health services to pupils of the local educational agency and in which there are provisions for the delivery of campus-based mental health services through qualified providers or qualified professionals to provide on-campus support to identify pupils with a specified education plan and pupils not in special education who a teacher believes may require those services and, with parental consent, to provide mental health services to those pupils. The bill would create the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund in the State Treasury, which would be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the State Department of Education for the purpose of funding these partnerships, as specified, and would require the State Department of Education to fund these partnerships through a competitive grant program.
The bill would require funds made available in the annual Budget Act for the purpose of providing educationally related mental health services required by an individualized education program to be used only for that purpose and would prohibit those funds from being deposited into the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund.","This bill allows a county, or a qualified provider operating as part of the county mental health plan network, and a local educational agency to enter into a partnership that includes: the coum 0; the local educational agency, with permission of the pupil's parent, provides the county mental health plan provider with the information of the health insurance carrier for each pupil; the agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency addresses how to cover the costs of mental health provider services not covered by funds if costs exceed the agreed-upon funding outlined in the partnership agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency following a year-end cost reconciliation process; the agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency fulfills reporting and other requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Medi-Cal EPSDT provisions; the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency participate in the performance outcome system established by the State Department of Health Care Services to measure results of services provided under the partnership agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency; and a plan to establish such a partnership in at least"
"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing federal law provides that assets in specified trusts shall not be considered for the purposes of determining an individual’s eligibility for, or amount of, benefits under Medicaid but provides that the state shall receive all amounts remaining in those trusts upon the death of the trust beneficiary. Existing state law provides that while a special needs trust, as specified, is in existence, the statute of limitations otherwise applicable to claims of the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Mental Health, the State Department of Developmental Services, and any county or city and county is tolled and that the trust property is subject to those claims at the death of the special needs trust beneficiary or on termination of the trust.
This bill would exempt from the claims of those entities the trust property of a deceased beneficiary if there is a surviving child who is a sibling of the deceased beneficiary, that surviving child is also the beneficiary of a special needs trust, and the trust of the deceased beneficiary provides for the transfer of the property in the trust of the deceased beneficiary to the special needs trust of the surviving sibling.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Probate Code of California to repeal the limitation on claims of the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Hospitals, the State Department of Developmental Services, and any county or city and county in California to the extent authorized by law as if the trust property is owned by the beneficiary or is part of the beneficiary's estate.

"Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law requires an independent solar energy producer, as defined, contracting for the use or sale of electricity or the lease of a solar energy system, as defined, to an entity or person for use in a residence to make certain disclosures to the buyer or lessee, including a plain language explanation of the contract provisions regulating the disposition or transfer of the contract in the event of a transfer of ownership of the residence, as well as the costs or potential costs associated with the disposition or transfer of the contract.

"Existing law allows every person who is unlawfully imprisoned or restrained of his or her liberty to prosecute a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of his or her imprisonment or restraint. Existing law allows a writ of habeas corpus to be prosecuted for, but not limited to, false evidence that is substantially material or probative to the issue of guilt or punishment that was introduced at trial and false physical evidence which was a material factor directly related to the plea of guilty of the person.
This bill would additionally allow a writ of habeas corpus to be prosecuted on the basis of new evidence that is credible, material, presented without substantial delay, and of such decisive force and value that it would have more likely than not changed the outcome at trial.
Existing law requires the California Victim Compensation Board to recommend an appropriation be made by the Legislature for the purpose of indemnifying a person if the evidence shows that a crime with which the person was charged was either not committed at all, or, if committed, was not committed by that person. Existing law requires that the appropriation recommended shall be a sum equivalent to $140 per day of incarceration served. If a court grants a writ of habeas corpus or vacates a judgment on the basis of new evidence and finds that the new evidence points unerringly to innocence, existing law requires the board to recommend an appropriation to the Legislature pursuant to these provisions without a hearing.
This bill would require the board, without a hearing, to recommend an appropriation to the Legislature if the court finds that the person is factually innocent. The bill would make additional clarifying and technical changes.","Amends the California Penal Code to allow a person unlawfully imprisoned or restrained of his or her liberty to prosecute a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of his or her imprisonment or restraint.

"Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires each department to develop and adopt regulations to ensure that enrollees have access to needed health care services in a timely manner.
Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Existing law requires each prepaid health plan to establish a grievance procedure under which enrollees may submit their grievances.
This bill would require a health care service plan contract or a health insurance policy that provides benefits through contracts with providers for alternative rates that is issued, renewed, or amended on or after July 1, 2017, to provide information to enrollees and insureds regarding the standards for timely access to health care services and other specified health care access information, including information related to receipt of interpreter services in a timely manner, no less than annually, and would make these provisions applicable to Medi-Cal managed care plans. The bill would also require a health care service plan or a health insurer that contracts with providers for alternative rates of payment to provide a contracting health care provider with specified information relating to the provision of referrals or health care services in a timely manner.
Because a willful violation of the bill’s provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

"Existing law, the Outdoor Advertising Act, provides for the regulation by the Department of Transportation of advertising displays, as defined, within view of public highways. The act regulates the placement of off-premises advertising displays along highways that generally advertise business conducted or services rendered or goods produced or sold at a location other than the property upon which the display is located. A violation of the act is a crime.
The act also provides that an advertising display advertising businesses and activities developed within the boundary limits of, and as a part of, an individual redevelopment agency project, as those project boundaries existed on December 29, 2011, may remain and be considered an on-premises display, until January 1, 2023, if the advertising display meets specified criteria. The act further authorizes, on and after January 1, 2022, the applicable city, county, or city and county to request from the department an extension for good cause, as specified, beyond January 1, 2023, not to exceed the expiration of the redevelopment project area.

For this purpose, existing law authorizes the commission, among other things, to borrow moneys from specified entities, including the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank, as specified, and pledge specified loans or the principal and interest payments on those loans to provide collateral in connection with those borrowed moneys. Existing law also authorizes the commission to enter into pledge agreements setting forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the commission is making those pledges.
This bill would extend the operation of all of those provisions to January 1, 2028, and would thereby make an appropriation by extending the time during which the funds deposited in a continuously appropriated account are made available for expenditure. The bill would authorize the commission to pledge collateral to secure the repayment of bonds or other borrowings by the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. The bill would also expressly authorize the commission to enter into pledge agreements pursuant to which the commission is pledging collateral to secure the repayment of bonds or other borrowings by the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank.","Amends the Public Resources Code to grant the California Energy Conservation Commission the power and authority to: (1) borrow money, for the purpose of obtaining funds to make loans, from the California Economic Development Financing Authority, the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank, and the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority from the proceeds of revenue bonds issued by any of those agencies; (2) pledge collateral to secure the repayment of moneys borrowed; (3) sell loans made pursuant to such Act, at prices determined in the sole discretion of the Commission, to the Authority, the Bank, and the Authority to raise funds to enable the Commission to make loans to eligible institutions; and (4) enter into loan agreements or other contracts necessary or appropriate in connection with the pledge or sale of loans, or the borrowing of money as provided above.<n><n>Declares that this Act provides a complete, separate, additional, and alternative method for implementing the measures authorized by this Act, including the authority of the eligible institutions or local jurisdictions to have borrowed and to borrow in the future pursuant to loans made pursuant to this Act and is supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws.<n><n>Repeals provisions of the Act concerning the State Energy Conservation Assistance Account on January 1, 2009.

"Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including telephone corporations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), pursuant to its existing authority over the North American Numbering Plan, has established several abbreviated dialing codes, including designating the number 9-1-1 for persons to dial to obtain emergency services, designating the number 3-1-1 for persons to dial for nonemergency police assistance, and designating the number 2-1-1 for persons to dial to obtain information about, and referral to, community social services. Pursuant to authority delegated by the FCC to state regulatory bodies and its existing statutory authority, the Public Utilities Commission has established procedures for implementing 2-1-1 dialing in California.
This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to facilitate the expansion of 2-1-1 services into those counties in California where they are lacking and to support a comprehensive statewide database that will connect all callers to information and referrals they need. The bill would additionally state the intent of the Legislature to facilitate access to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery information, and referral services, uniformly in the state, especially in hard-to-serve rural areas, through a universally available telephone service.
Existing law requires the commission to develop, implement, and administer a program to advance universal service by providing discounted rates to qualifying schools, community colleges, libraries, hospitals, health clinics, and community organizations. Existing law requires that all revenues collected by telephone corporations in rates authorized by the commission to fund this program be deposited in the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee Fund. Existing law provides that moneys in the fund are held in trust and may be expended only upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act or upon supplemental appropriation and requires that all moneys appropriated to the commission from the fund be used exclusively for the program.
If the commission determines that doing so is an appropriate use of funds collected from ratepayers, the bill would, until January 1, 2023, authorize the commission to expend up to $1,500,000 from the fund to help close 2-1-1 service gaps in counties lacking access to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery information and referral services, where technically feasible, through available 2-1-1 service.","Establishes the California Teleconnect Fund Administrative Committee to advise the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on the development, implementation, and administration of a program to advance universal service by providing discounted rates to qualifying schools maintaining kindergarten or any of grades one to 12, inclusive, community colleges, libraries, hospitals, health clinics, and community organizations.

Existing law defines the term “university” to mean the campuses of the University of California, including the medical centers. The law requires, on or before January 1, 2016, the Regents of the University of California to report to specific committees of the Legislature regarding the pilot program, including, among other information, a description of the projects awarded using the best value procedures.
This bill would extend the provisions of the pilot program until January 1, 2018, and would repeal the reporting requirement. This bill would modify the definition of the term “university” to mean all locations of the University of California.
(2) By extending the requirement that bidders verify specified information under oath, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding the scope of an existing crime.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Public Contract Code to provide for a Best Value Construction Contracting Pilot Program for the Regents of the University of California for projects over one million dollars. The lowest responsible bidder may be selected on the basis of the best value to the university, as defined by this bill.

Existing law provides limited exceptions to these restrictions under which a licensee is authorized to drive under specified circumstances, including a
schooling
school
or school-authorized activity or an employment necessity, and requires the licensee to keep certain supporting documentation in his or her possession. A violation of these provisions is punishable as an infraction.
This bill would expand the scope of the provisional licensing program by extending the applicable age range for the program from 16 to under 18 years of age to 16 to under 21 years of age. By expanding the scope of the provisional licensing program, the violation of which constitutes an infraction, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize a licensee who is 18, 19, or 20 years of age to keep in his or her possession a copy of his or her class schedule or work schedule as documentation to satisfy the exceptions for

Existing law requires regional centers to notify the department of all qualified opinion reports or reports noting significant issues that directly or indirectly impact regional center services within 30 days after receipt.
This bill would also require a regional center to submit copies of all independent audit reports that it receives to the department for review.

Requires: (1) the letter to be sent by certified mail to the last known address of the person or entity alleged to have engaged in the unlawful act or practice; and (2) the letter to be sent to an authorized representative of the person or entity that is alleged to have engaged in the unlawful act or practice. Provides for: (1) the response to the aggrieved person's letter; and (2) the statute of limitations on a claim arising from the alleged unlawful act or practice to be tolled for a period of 30 days following the date of mailing, plus any additional period during which the parties engage in negotiations under this Act.

"Existing law, the State Bar Act, requires an applicant for admission and a license to practice law, to meet certain requirements, including, but not limited to, having completed certain legal education in a law school, law office, or judge’s chambers, passed an examination in professional responsibility, and passed the general bar examination. Existing law prohibits a person from practicing law in this state unless he or she is an active member of the State Bar.
This bill would additionally require an applicant, prior to admission, to complete at least 50 hours of supervised pro bono legal service, as specified, in order to supplement the applicant’s legal education with practical legal work experience. Upon completion of the pro bono legal service requirement, the bill would require an applicant and the supervisor, as defined, to complete and sign a form confirming completion of the pro bono service. The bill would require the State Bar to adopt rules for the retention of the certification forms. The bill would authorize the State Bar to create the form upon which an applicant can report completion of pro bono service. The bill would require the State Bar to randomly audit submitted forms to ensure compliance with these provisions. The bill would provide that these provisions apply to all applicants who enter law school on or after January 1, 2018.","Prohibits an applicant for admission and a license to practice from satisfying the requirements of this Act regardless of the manner or law school in which an applicant acquires or completes his or her legal education, unless: (1) such applicant completes at least 50 hours of pro bono legal service prior to admission; and (2) such applicant and the supervising attorney with the appropriate licensing to represent the client before the relevant judicial body or government agency perform such service, for one of specified purposes."
"(1) Existing law, the California Safe Drinking Water Act, imposes on the State Water Resources Control Board various responsibilities and duties relating to providing a dependable, safe supply of drinking water. The act prohibits a person from operating a public water system unless he or she first submits an application, including a technical report, to the state board and receives a permit, as specified. The act requires the state board, upon determination that the application is complete, to make a specified investigation, and allows the state board to impose permit conditions, requirements for system improvements, and time schedules as the state board deems necessary to ensure an affordable, reliable, and adequate supply of water at all times that is pure, wholesome, and potable. The act provides that a person who knowingly makes a false statement or representation in a report submitted, maintained, or used for purposes of compliance with the act may be punished as a misdemeanor.
This bill would require a person submitting an application for a permit for a proposed new public water system to first submit a preliminary technical report to the state board at least 6 months before initiating construction of any water-related improvement, as defined. Because a misstatement in the report could be a crime under the provision described above, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding the scope of a crime. The bill would allow the state board to direct the applicant to undertake additional discussion and negotiation with certain existing public water systems the state board determines have the technical, managerial, and financial capacity to provide an adequate and reliable supply of domestic water to the service area of the proposed new public water system, as specified, and would require an applicant to comply before submitting an application for a permit to operate a system and would prohibit the application from being deemed complete unless the applicant has complied. The bill would, if the state board determines that it is feasible for the service area of the public water system addressed by the application to be served by one or more currently permitted public water systems, authorize the state board to deny the permit of a proposed new public water system if it determines that it is reasonably foreseeable that the proposed new public water system will be unable to provide affordable, safe drinking water in the reasonably foreseeable future, as prescribed.
(2) Existing law allows the state board to delegate primary responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the act within a county to a local health officer if certain criteria are met. Existing law requires that the local primacy agency be empowered with all of the authority granted to the state board over the specified public water systems.
This bill would prohibit a local primacy agency from issuing a permit to operate a public water system without the concurrence of the state board. The bill would require, for a proposed new public water system that would be regulated by a local primacy agency, the applicant to also submit a copy of the preliminary technical report to the state board.
(3) Existing law declares the established policy of the state that every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes. Existing law requires a city or county that determines a project, as defined, is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act to identify certain water systems that may supply water for the project and to request those public water systems to prepare and approve a specified water supply assessment. Under existing law, if no public water system is identified, the city or county is required to prepare and approve the water supply assessment. Existing law provides that if, as a result of its assessment, the public water system or city or county concludes that its water supplies are, or will be, insufficient, the public water system or city or county is required to provide its plans for acquiring additional water supplies, as prescribed.
This bill would prohibit a city, including a charter city, or a county from issuing a building permit for the construction of a new residential development where a source of the water supply is water transported by a water hauler, bottled water, a water-vending machine, or a retail water facility, as specified. By imposing new duties on a city or county in connection with the issuance of a building permit, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons.","This bill declares that it is the policy of California to discourage the establishment of new, unsustainable public water systems when there is a feasible alternative. Before a person submits an application for a permit for a proposed new public water system, the person must first submit a preliminary technical report to the California State Water Resources Board at least six months before initiating construction of any water-related improvement. The preliminary technical report must include: the name of each public water system for which any service area boundary is within three miles, as measured through existing public rights-of-way; a discussion of the feasibility of each adjacent public water system regarding the feasibility of annexing, connecting, or otherwise supplying domestic water to the applicant's proposed new public water system; all sources of domestic water supply for the proposed new public water system; the estimated cost to construct, operate, and maintain the proposed new public water system; a comparison of the costs associated with providing water to the proposed new public water system to the costs associated with providing water to the existing public water system; a discussion of all actions taken by the applicant to pursue a contract for managerial or operational oversight from an existing public water system; and an analysis of whether a proposed new public water system complies with the projected water demand for the service"
"Existing law, as amended by Proposition 21 as approved by the voters at the March 7, 2000, statewide primary election and by Proposition 83 of the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, classifies certain felonies as violent felonies for purposes of various provisions of the Penal Code. Existing law imposes an additional one-year term for a felony and a 3-year term for a violent felony for each prior separate prison term served for a violent felony. Existing law, as added by Proposition 184, adopted November 8, 1994, and amended by Proposition 36, adopted November 6, 2012, commonly known as the Three Strikes Law, also imposes additional years of imprisonment in state prison on a person who commits a violent felony and has been convicted of, or who has a prior conviction for, a violent felony. The Legislature may amend the above-specified initiative statutes by a statute passed in each house by a
2/3
vote.
This bill would additionally define human trafficking as a violent felony subject to the enhanced term of imprisonment.
Because this bill would increase penalties for a violation of human trafficking crimes, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law regulates the operation of watercraft, as defined, in the waterways of the state. Existing law defines a “watercraft” for purposes of those provisions to mean any boat, ship, barge, craft, or floating thing designed for navigation in the water.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes in that definition of watercraft.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on October 26, 2015. (Sec. 2) This bill amends the California Penal Code to revise requirements for prison terms for new offenses committed on or after November 7, 2012, to require the court to impose a three-year term for each prior separate prison term served where if the prior offense was one of specified violent felonies, provided that the defendant remained free of both prison custody and the commission of an offense which results in a felony conviction. However, no additional term shall be imposed for any prison term served prior to a period of 10 years in which the defendant remained free of both prison custody and the commission of such an offense. The court must impose a one-year term for each prior separate prison term or county jail term imposed if the new offense is any felony for which a prison sentence or sentence of imprisonment in a county jail is imposed or is not suspended, in addition and consecutive to any other sentence therefor, provided that no felony. An additional term shall not be imposed under this subdivision for any prison or county jail term imposed under the provisions of this bill or when the sentence is not suspended prior to a period of five years in which the defendant remained free of both prison custody and the commission of such an offense"
"Existing law contains provisions governing the operation and financing of community mental health services for the mentally disordered in every county through locally administered and locally controlled community mental health programs. Existing law, the Mental Health Services Act, an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, funds a system of county mental health plans for the provision of mental health services, as specified.
The act establishes the Mental Health Services Fund,
which is
continuously appropriated
to
to,
and administered
by
by,
the State Department of Health Care Services, to fund specified county mental health programs, including programs funded under the Adult and Older Adult Mental Health System of Care Act. Existing law prohibits these funds from being used to pay for persons incarcerated in state prison or parolees from state prisons.
This bill would clarify that the counties may use Mental Health Services Fund moneys to provide
voluntary
outpatient crisis stabilization services to
individuals who are voluntarily receiving those services,
individuals,
even when individuals who are receiving
involuntary
services
involuntarily
are treated at the same facility. Because the bill would clarify the procedures and terms of Proposition 63, it would require a majority vote of the Legislature.","This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to require the state to distribute funds for the provision of services under the Mental Health Services Act to county mental health programs, which shall be available to adults and seniors with severe illnesses who meet eligibility criteria in specified subdivisions. Funding shall be provided at sufficient levels to ensure that counties can provide each adult and senior served pursuant to this part with the medically necessary mental health services, medications, and supportive services set forth in the applicable treatment plan. The funding shall cover the portions of those costs that cannot be paid for with other funds, including other mental health funds, public and private insurance, and other local, state, and federal funds. Each county mental health program plan shall provide for services in accordance with the system of care for adults and seniors who meet the eligibility criteria in specified subdivisions. Planning for services shall be consistent with the philosophy, principles, and practices of the Recovery Vision recovery vision for mental health consumers: (1) to promote concepts key to the recovery for individuals who have mental illness: hope, personal empowerment, social connections, self-responsibility, and self-operated services; (2) to promote consumer-determination; (3) to reflect the cultural, ethnic, and racial diversity of mental health consumers; and (4) to plan for each consumer's individual"
"The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, administered by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, regulates the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages and the granting of licenses for the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages within the state. The act also provides for a limitation on the amount of on-sale general licenses that may be issued by the department based on the population of the county in which the licensed premises are located, as provided. Existing law also provides for various annual fees for the issuance of alcoholic beverage licenses, depending on the type of license issued.
This bill would, beginning January 1, 2017, provide an exception to the license limitation for a county of the 6th class, as specified, for 5 new original neighborhood-restricted special on-sale general licenses for premises located within specified census tracts in that county, subject to specified requirements. This bill would impose an original fee and annual renewal fee for the license, which would be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund, and would require an applicant for this license to submit a specified application, submitted under the penalty of perjury, to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. This bill would also require the applicant to submit a signed verification by the local government in which the licensed premises would be located stating that the applicant has completed certain preapplication requirements.
By requiring an applicant to submit an application under penalty of perjury, thereby expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason and that no reimbursement shall be made pursuant to those statutory provisions for costs mandated by the state pursuant to this act, but would recognize that local agencies and school districts may pursue any available remedies to seek reimbursement for these costs.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City and County of San Francisco.","This bill prohibits in any county of the sixth class department from issuing no more than a total five new original neighborhood-restricted special licenses to premises located in specified census tracts within San Francisco and the surrounding area. To qualify for such a license, the premises for which the license would apply must be located within one of certain census tracts located within the city and county of San Francisco. The bill prescribes requirements for: the applicant to conduct a minimum of one preapplication meeting with neighbors and members of the community within the census tract in which the premises are located, (2) the issuance of such a license, and (3) the transfer of such a license. A license shall not be issued to an applicant until any existing on-sale licenses issued to the applicant for the same premises are canceled."
"Existing law generally regulates formation and enforcement of contracts, including what constitutes an unlawful contract. Under existing law, a contract is unlawful if it is contrary to an express provision of law, contrary to the policy of express law, though not expressly prohibited, or otherwise contrary to good morals.
Existing law authorizes a county board of supervisors on behalf of its sheriff, and a legislative body of a city on behalf of its chief of police, to contract to provide supplemental law enforcement services to private individuals, private entities, and private corporations in specified circumstances and subject to certain conditions.
This bill would, commencing on January 1, 2018, prohibit a city, county, or a city and county, or a local law enforcement agency from entering into or renewing a contract, or modifying a contract to extend the length of the contract, with a private corporation, contractor, or vendor to detain immigrants in civil immigration proceedings for profit.
Existing law requires the Board of State and Community Corrections to establish minimum standards for local correctional facilities, as specified.
This bill would require a city, county, or city and county, or a local law enforcement agency that chooses to enter into a contract to detain immigrants in civil immigration proceedings to detain immigrants only pursuant to a contract that requires the immigration detention facility operator to adhere to specified standards.
The California Public Records Act requires state and local agencies to make their records available for public inspection and to make copies available upon request and payment of a fee unless the records are exempt from disclosure.
This bill would specify that any facility that detains an immigrant pursuant to a contract with a city, county, city and county, or a local law enforcement agency is subject to the California Public Records Act.
Existing law, the Unruh Civil Rights Act, provides that all persons within the jurisdiction of California are free and equal no matter their national origin, citizenship, or immigration status and are entitled to full and equal accommodations, facilities, and privileges in all business establishments of every kind. Persons denied their rights under this act may obtain specified remedies, including treble damages.
This bill would provide that an immigration detention facility operator, as defined, an agent thereof, or a person acting on its behalf, shall not deprive an immigrant detainee in civil immigration proceedings of specified rights, including access to an attorney or other authorized person, medical care, freedom from harm or harassment, or privacy. The bill would prohibit an immigration detention facility from involuntarily placing a detainee in segregated housing because of his or her actual or perceived gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation.
This bill would authorize the Attorney General or any district attorney or city attorney to bring a civil action against an immigration detention facility, an agent thereof, or a person acting on its behalf that violates a detainee’s rights, as specified.
The bill would provide that its provisions are severable.",". The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.) (Sec. 2) This bill prohibits a city, county, city and county, or a local law enforcement agency from entering into or renewing a contract, or modifying a contract to extend the length of such contract, with a private corporation, contractor, or vendor to detain immigrants in civil immigration proceedings. If such a city, county, city and county chooses to enter into a contract, renews a contract, or modifies a contract to extend the length of the contract, it shall detain immigrants only pursuant to a contract that requires the immigration detention facility operator to adhere to the standards in the 2011 Operations Manual ICE Performance-Based National Detention Standards as corrected and clarified in February 2013 and ICE Directive 11065.1 (Review of the Use of Segregation for ICE Detainees).

"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including specialty mental health services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. Under existing law, specialty mental health services are provided by mental health plans and the department is responsible for conducting investigations and audits of claims and reimbursements for expenditures for specialty mental health services provided by mental health plans to Medi-Cal eligible individuals.
This bill would require annual mental health plan reviews to be conducted by an external quality review organization (EQRO) and, commencing July 1, 2018, would require those reviews to include specific data for Medi-Cal eligible minor and nonminor dependents in foster care, including the number of Medi-Cal eligible minor and nonminor dependents in foster care served each year. The bill would require the department to share data with county boards of supervisors, including data that will assist in the development of mental health service plans and performance outcome system data and metrics, as specified.
This bill would require the department to post any corrective action plan prepared by the mental health plan to address deficiencies identified by the EQRO review and the EQRO data on its Internet Web site, as specified. The bill would also require the department to notify the mental health plan of any deficiencies and would require the mental health plan to provide a written corrective action plan to the department.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 22, 2017.

"(1) Existing law sets forth the duties of the grand jury
of each county
. Existing law requires the grand jury to submit to the presiding judge of the superior court a final report of its findings and recommendations that pertain to county government matters during the fiscal or calendar year. Existing law authorizes a grand jury to request a subject person or entity to come before the grand jury for the purpose of reading and discussing the findings of the grand jury report that relates to that person or entity in order to verify the accuracy of the findings prior to their release.
This bill would require a grand jury to request a subject person or entity to come before the grand jury as described above. The bill would authorize a grand jury to disclose the factual data used in making its findings during discussions conducted pursuant to these provisions.
This bill would authorize a grand jury to provide to a subject person or entity for comment an administrative draft of that portion of the grand jury’s report relating to that subject person or entity. The bill would require an administrative draft provided pursuant to this provision to include proposed grand jury findings, would authorize the draft to include the factual data utilized in making the grand jury’s findings, and would prohibit the draft from including the grand jury’s recommendations. Within a time period determined by the grand jury, but no sooner than 10 days after the grand jury submits an administrative draft of its report to a subject person or entity for comment, the bill would authorize the subject person or entity to file with the grand jury written comments on the findings and data included in the administrative draft pertaining to that subject person or entity. The bill would prohibit an officer, agency, department, or governing body of a public agency from disclosing any contents of the administrative draft of the report prior to the public release of the final report.
This bill would delete the authority of a grand jury to request a subject person or entity to come before it for purposes of reading and discussing the findings of a grand jury report. The bill would instead require a grand jury to conduct at least one exit interview of an official or other responsible representative of each entity to which recommendations will be directed in a final grand jury report. The bill would authorize the grand jury, with the court’s approval, to provide to the exit interviewee a copy of the draft findings related to that entity and would allow the subject entity to provide written comments to the grand jury concerning the draft findings within a time to be determined by the grand jury, but at least 5 working days after providing the draft findings to the exit interviewee. The bill would require any draft findings given to the exit interviewee to remain confidential, would prohibit those findings from being distributed to anyone outside the entity prior to or after the release of the final report, and would prohibit the exit interviewee and any board, officer, employee, or agent of the entity from publicly revealing any other information obtained during the exit interview prior to the public release of the report.
Existing law requires a grand jury to provide to the affected agency a copy of the portion of the grand jury report relating to that person or entity 2 working days prior to its public release and after the approval of the presiding judge.

(3)
(4)
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","Amends the Federal criminal code to require a responding person or entity, as to each grand jury recommendation, to report: (1) the recommendation has been implemented, with a summary regarding it; (2) it has not yet been implemented, but will be implemented in the future; (3) the recommendation requires further analysis, with an explanation and the scope and parameters of an analysis or study, and a timeframe for the matter to be prepared for discussion by the officer or head of the agency or department being investigated or reviewed; and (4) the recommendation will not be implemented because it is not warranted or is not reasonable, with an explanation.

"Existing law authorizes the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) to implement a program in urban forestry to encourage better tree management and planting in urban areas to increase integrated, multibenefit projects by assisting urban areas with innovative solutions to problems, including greenhouse gas emissions, public health impacts of poor air and water quality, urban heat island effect, stormwater management, water shortages, lack of green space, lack of urban parks that are accessible to pedestrians, vandalism, and insufficient tree maintenance.
Existing law authorizes the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) to develop a program to increase the use of compost products in agricultural applications.
This bill would enact the Community Climate and Drought Resilience Program of 2016 and would require CalFire to review the urban forestry program and, if necessary, revise the program to provide funding priority to multibenefit carbon sequestration projects and to establish local or regional targets for urban tree canopy.
The bill would require CalRecycle, by July 1, 2017, to develop and implement a program that provides incentives for certain projects that increase drought resilience and result in quantifiable reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases through increased carbon sequestration in urban and rural areas.
Existing law requires the California Environmental Protection Agency, in coordination with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, the State Water Resources Control Board, the State Air Resources Board, and the Department of Food and Agriculture, to develop and implement policies to aid in diverting organic waste from landfills by promoting the composting of specified organic waste and by promoting the appropriate use of that compost throughout the state. Existing law requires the agency and the Department of Food and Agriculture, with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, the State Water Resources Control Board, and the State Air Resources Board, to perform specified functions, including developing recommendations for promoting organic waste processing and recycling infrastructure statewide.
This bill would require the agency and the Department of Food and Agriculture, with the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, the State Water Resources Control Board, and the State Air Resources Board, to additionally assess state programs to determine how those programs may increase the use of compost for specified purposes and develop recommendations for promoting the use of compost throughout the state. The bill would require that those recommendations be posted on the agency’s Internet Web site no later than January 1, 2018, and be updated annually thereafter. The bill would require an implementing agency, required to be identified with those recommendations, to develop a program to implement policies for promoting the use of compost throughout the state, if recommended, and, for purposes of that program, to prioritize projects that utilize the services of community conservation corps or other local nonprofit entities that employ underprivileged youth.","This bill requires the California Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and implement policies to aid in diverting organic waste from landfills by promoting the use of agricultural, forestry, and urban organic waste as a feedstock for compost and promoting the appropriate use of that compost throughout the state. In developing such policies, the EPA must promote a goal of reducing at least five million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year through the development and application of compost on working lands. The EPA and the Department of Food and Agriculture must ensure proper coordination of agency regulations and goals to implement this bill. The EPA must develop a program to implement policies for promoting the use of compost throughout the state, if specified goals are met. The bill also requires at least one public workshop annually to inform the public of actions taken to implement this bill and to receive public comment."
"Existing law requires, as a condition of parole, a prisoner who has a severe mental disorder that is not in remission and who meets specified criteria to be treated by the State Department of State Hospitals and provided the necessary treatment. In order for that commitment to occur, existing law requires, among other criteria, that the severe mental disorder be one of the causes of, or an aggravating factor in, the commission of the crime, as defined, for which the prisoner was sentenced to prison. Existing law also requires the prisoner to have been in treatment for the severe mental disorder for 90 days or more within the year prior to the prisoner’s parole or release. Existing law establishes procedures for the evaluation of a prisoner under these provisions by specified health practitioners of the State Department of State Hospitals and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
This bill would authorize the use of certain documentary evidence for purposes of satisfying the criteria used to evaluate whether a prisoner released on parole is required to be treated by the State Department of State Hospitals.","Amends the Federal criminal code to require the State Department of State Hospitals, as a condition of parole, to treat a California prisoner who meets specified criteria, including that the prisoner has a severe mental disorder that is not in remission or that cannot be kept in remission without treatment and that was one of the causes of, or an aggravating factor in, the commission of a crime for which the prisoner was sentenced to prison."
"Under existing law, the California FAIR (fair access to insurance requirements) Plan Association is a joint reinsurance association of state insurers that is established to, among other things, assist persons in securing basic property insurance for qualified property for which insurance cannot be obtained through the normal insurance market. Existing law requires the association to establish and maintain a toll-free telephone number through which a person may receive assistance in applying for basic property insurance. Existing law requires an insurer member of the plan to provide to an applicant who is denied coverage the toll-free telephone number for the plan for information and assistance in obtaining basic property insurance. Existing law requires an agent or broker transacting basic property insurance to either assist a person in making an application for insurance through the plan or to provide the person with that toll-free telephone number.
This bill would additionally require the association to establish and maintain an Internet Web site at which a person may receive information and assistance in applying for insurance through the plan and would require the association to include the toll-free telephone number and the Internet Web site address on all communications with an applicant or an insured. The bill, beginning March 1, 2017, would require an insurer member to provide an applicant denied coverage or a policyholder whose policy is canceled or not renewed both that Internet Web site address and toll-free telephone number. The bill would delete the provision permitting an agent or broker to provide the toll-free telephone number of the plan as an alternative to assisting a person in making an application for insurance through the plan, and would instead require an agent or broker to assist a person seeking his or her help in obtaining basic property insurance coverage by making an application for insurance through the plan by submitting an application at the person’s request, by providing the person with the California FAIR Plan’s Internet Web site address and the toll-free telephone number, or by making an application for insurance, at the person’s request, and placing that person with or through an insurer that offers, or a surplus line broker that procures, basic property insurance coverage.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on October 19, 2015. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Insurance Code to revise requirements for an association of insurers licensed to write basic property insurance in California to require the association to submit a proposed plan of operation to the state commissioner of insurance. The plan must: authorize the association to assume and cede reinsurance on risks written by insurers in conformity with the program; and include provisions for participation by an insurer in the writings, expenses, and profits and losses of the association in the proportion that its premiums written during the second preceding calendar year bear to the aggregate premiums written by all insurers in the program, excluding that portion of the premiums written attributable to the operation of the association. Premiums written on a policy of basic residential earthquake insurance issued by the California Earthquake Authority shall be attributed to the insurer that writes the underlying policy of residential property insurance. Voting on administrative questions of the association and facility shall be weighted in accordance with each insurer's authority to transact premiums written during the second preceding calendar year as disclosed in reports filed by the insurer with the commissioner. The plan must also: provide for a plan to encourage persons to secure basic property insurance through normal channels from an admitted insurer or a licensed surplus line broker by informing"
"Existing property tax law authorizes the board of supervisors of a county to provide that every assessee or person liable for taxes on any taxable property whose property was damaged or destroyed without his or her fault may apply for reassessment of that property, as provided. To be eligible for reassessment, existing law requires that the damage or destruction of the property be caused by specified circumstances, including a major misfortune or calamity in an area or region subsequently proclaimed by the Governor to be in a state of disaster.
This bill would additionally authorize the board of supervisors of a county to provide for reassessment of property destroyed or damaged by a major misfortune or calamity in an area or region subsequently proclaimed by the Governor to be in a state of emergency. The bill would specify that “damage” includes a diminution in the value of property as a result of environmental contamination. The bill would also provide that the amendments made by its provisions would apply retroactively to property located in the Porter Ranch neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles that was affected by the methane gas leak in that area in 2015 and 2016 and that, with respect to these properties, the application for reassessment may be filed within 12 months of the enactment of this bill or within the time specified in the ordinance, whichever is later. The bill would specify that these provisions do not alter existing law regarding claims or defenses related to diminution of property values or establish a presumption that property values have declined or that any property is in any way “damaged or destroyed” or otherwise “contaminated” for purposes of a civil action related to the methane gas leak in the Porter Ranch neighborhood.
Existing law requires the assessed value of the property in its damaged condition, determined as specified, to be the taxable value of the property until it is restored, repaired, reconstructed, or other provisions of the law require the establishment of a new base year value. Existing law, if partial reconstruction, restoration, or repair has occurred on any subsequent lien date, requires the taxable value to be increased by a specified amount.
This bill, for property destroyed or damaged in an area or region proclaimed by the Governor to be in a state of emergency, on the 3rd lien date following the calamity, if partial reconstruction, restoration, or repair is not progressing in a timely fashion, would require the assessed value of the property to be determined, as specified.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to authorize an ordinance adopted by the county board of supervisors to provide that everyee of any taxable property, or any person liable for taxes on that property, whose property was damaged or destroyed without his or her fault, may apply for reassessment of that property. Permits such ordinance to also specify that the assessor may initiate the reassessment where the assessor determines that within the preceding 12 months taxable property located in the county was damaged or destroyed, including a drought condition as existed in California in 1976 and 1977."
"Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to place or maintain any sign, picture, transparency, advertisement, or mechanical device for the purpose of advertising on public or private property without lawful permission or consent of the owner. Existing law allows information that appears on the advertisement to be used as evidence to establish the fact that a person or entity is responsible for posting the advertisement.
This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to these provisions.
Existing law requires the Board of Parole Hearings to meet with an inmate during the 6th year prior to the inmate’s minimum eligible parole release date to document the inmate’s activities and conduct pertinent to parole eligibility. Existing law, the Victims’ Bill of Rights Act of 2008: Marsy’s Law, as added by Proposition 9 at the November 4, 2008, statewide general election, requires the panel, or the board if sitting en banc, to set a release date at the meeting, unless it determines that consideration of the public and victim’s safety requires a more lengthy period of incarceration, and that a parole date cannot be fixed at the meeting. Existing law requires the board to schedule the next parole consideration hearing 15, 10, 7, 5, or 3 years after any hearing at which parole is denied. Existing law allows the board to advance a hearing set pursuant to these provisions to an earlier date when a change in circumstances or new information establishes a reasonable likelihood that consideration of the public and victim’s safety does not require an additional period of incarceration.
Existing law, as added by Proposition 184, adopted November 8, 1994, and amended by Proposition 36, adopted November 6, 2012, commonly known as the Three Strikes Law, imposes increased penalties for certain recidivist offenders. In particular, it requires that, in addition to any other enhancement or penalty provisions that may apply, if a defendant has 2 or more prior felony convictions, the term for the current felony conviction shall be an indeterminate term of imprisonment in the state prison for life with a minimum term of the greatest of 3 times the term otherwise provided as punishment for each current felony conviction subsequent to the 2 or more prior felony convictions, imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years, or the term determined by the court for the underlying conviction, including any applicable enhancement or punishment provisions. The initiative measure enacting the Three Strikes Law prohibits the Legislature from amending the act except by a statute passed by a
2

vote or by a statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors.
This bill would establish the Elderly Parole Program, for prisoners who are 50 years of age or older, who have served 15 years of their sentence, and who have a reentry plan identifying residential, financial, and social integration plans. When considering the release of an inmate who meets this criteria, the bill would require the board to consider whether age, time served, and diminished physical condition, if any, have reduced the elderly prisoner’s risk for future violence. The bill would also require the Board of Parole Hearings to consider whether a prisoner will qualify for the program when determining the prisoner’s next parole suitability hearing.",". The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) This bill amends the California criminal code to prohibit the posting on any sign, picture, transparency, advertisement, or mechanical device of the following identifying information: the name, telephone number, address, or other identifying information regarding the real estate broker, brokerage firm, real estate agent, or other person associated with the firm; the name, telephone number, address, or other identifying information of the owner or lessee of property used for a commercial activity or event; or the name, telephone number, address, or other identifying information of the sponsor or promoter of a sporting event, concert, theatrical performance, or similar activity or event. For purposes of this bill, information that appears on any such sign, picture, transparency, advertisement, or mechanical device may be used as evidence to establish the fact, and may create an inference that a person or entity is responsible for the posting of the sign, picture, transparency, advertisement, or mechanical device. Under current law, prisoners who are 60 years of age or older and who have been incarcerated 25 years or more on their current sentence are referred to the Board of Parole Hearings to determine suitability for parole.

"Existing law makes confidential, upon request, the home addresses of specified governmental officials, peace officers, state employees, and certain other persons that appear in the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Existing law also makes confidential, upon request, the home address of the spouse or child of any of those persons, or the surviving spouse or child of a peace officer if the peace officer died in the line of duty, except for a spouse, surviving spouse, or child who was convicted of a crime and is on active parole or probation. Existing law prohibits the disclosure of the confidential home addresses described above, except as specified. Existing law requires a record of the department containing a confidential home address to be open to public inspection, as specified, if the address is completely obliterated or otherwise removed from the record. Existing law also provides that the home address of the surviving spouse or child of a peace officer, as specified, shall be withheld from public inspection for 3 years following the death of the peace officer.
This bill would require the department to discontinue holding a home address confidential, pursuant to the above provisions, for a child or spouse of specified persons if the child or spouse is convicted of a felony in this state or is convicted of an offense in another jurisdiction that, if committed in California, would be a felony.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2010.

"The California Constitution requires the reasonable and beneficial use of water and that the conservation of the water resources of the state is to be exercised with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use of the water in the interest of the people and for the public welfare. Existing law, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, requires all groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins by the Department of Water Resources and designated as subject to critical conditions of overdraft to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2020, and requires all other groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2022, except as specified.
This bill, by January 1, 2018, would require a city or county overlying a basin designated as a high- or medium-priority basin to establish a process for the issuance of a groundwater extraction permit for the development of a groundwater extraction facility that requires an applicant for a groundwater extraction permit to demonstrate, based on substantial evidence, that extraction of groundwater from a proposed groundwater extraction facility will not contribute to or create an undesirable result, as prescribed. The bill would prohibit a groundwater extraction facility in a high- or medium-priority basin from being developed without a valid groundwater extraction permit, with certain exceptions. The bill would not require a city or county overlying a medium- or high-priority basin to have a process for the issuance of a groundwater extraction permit for the development of a groundwater extraction facility on or after January 31, 2022, or once the department has evaluated a groundwater sustainability plan for the basin the city or county overlies and determined the plan to be adequate and likely to achieve the sustainability goal for the basin, whichever comes first. By increasing the duties of cities and counties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires a city or county to establish a process for the issuance of a groundwater extraction permit for a groundwater extraction facility: (1) that requires an applicant for a permit to demonstrate that extraction of groundwater from a proposed facility will not contribute to or create an undesirable result related to drinking water standards or groundwater overdraft; or (2) designated as a high- or medium-priority basin by the Department of Water Resources. A city or county must also establish: (1) standards that the extraction of groundwater from a proposed facility will not contribute to or create an undesirable result related to drinking water standards or groundwater overdraft, and (2) a process for the issuance of a groundwater extraction permit that meets specified requirements. The Department of Water Resources may not issue a groundwater extraction permit for a proposed facility in a high- or medium-priority basin: (1) unless the department has received information that the facility will not contribute to or create an undesirable result related to drinking water standards or groundwater overdraft and that the proposed facility is unlikely to cause such a result, or (2) unless the department has received information that the facility is likely to cause such a result and has established a process for issuing a permit."
"(1) Existing law establishes in state government the Transportation Agency, which includes various departments and state entities, including the California Transportation Commission. Existing law vests the California Transportation Commission with specified powers, duties, and functions relative to transportation matters. Existing law requires the commission to retain independent authority to perform the duties and functions prescribed to it under any provision of law.
This bill would exclude the California Transportation Commission from the Transportation Agency, establish it as an entity in state government, and require it to act in an independent oversight role. The bill would also make conforming changes.
(2) Existing law requires the Department of Transportation to prepare a state highway operation and protection program every other year for the expenditure of transportation capital improvement funds for projects that are necessary to preserve and protect the state highway system, excluding projects that add new traffic lanes. The program is required to be based on an asset management plan, as specified. Existing law requires the department to specify, for each project in the program, the capital and support budget and projected delivery date for various components of the project. Existing law provides for the California Transportation Commission to review and adopt the program, and authorizes the commission to decline to adopt the program if it determines that the program is not sufficiently consistent with the asset management plan.
This bill would additionally require the department to program capital outlay support resources for each project in the program. The bill would provide that the commission is not required to approve the program in its entirety, as submitted by the department, and may approve or reject individual projects programmed by the department. The bill would require the department to submit any change in a programmed project’s cost, scope, or schedule to the commission for its approval.","This bill requires the Department of Transportation, based on its asset management plan, to prepare for review by the California Transportation Commission a state highway operation and protection program for the expenditure of transportation funds for major capital improvements necessary to preserve and protect the state highway system. Projects included in the program shall be limited to capital improvements relative to maintenance, safety, and rehabilitation of state highways and bridges that do not add a new traffic lane to the system. The program shall include projects that are expected to be advertised prior to July 1 of the year following submission of the program, but which have not yet been funded. The program shall include: those projects for which construction is to begin within four fiscal years, starting July 1 of the year following the program is submitted; the capital and support budget, as well as a projected delivery date, for each project in the state highway operation and protection program, the capital adequacy and funding priorities established in the Streets and Highways Code, and estimates of annual funding needed to implement those expenditures on the state transportation improvement program; and acquisition of rights-of-way, including the acquisition of rights-of-way for projects submitted to the commission. The commission may decline to adopt the program if it determines that the program is not sufficiently consistent with the asset management plan"
"Existing law generally provides for the reimbursement of victims and derivative victims of specified types of crimes by the California Victim Compensation Board from the Restitution Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, for specified losses suffered as a result of those crimes. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, authorizes the board to grant from the fund for pecuniary losses, when the board determines it will best aid the person seeking compensation, reimbursement for outpatient psychiatric, psychological, or other mental health counseling-related expenses incurred by the victim or derivative victim, as specified. Existing law sets forth eligibility requirements and limits on the amount of compensation the board may award, and requires the application for compensation to be verified under penalty of perjury.
This bill would extend the board’s authority to grant reimbursement for those outpatient psychiatric, psychological, or other mental health counseling-related expenses until January 1, 2019. By expanding the authorization for the use of moneys in the Restitution Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation. Because an application for reimbursement is required to be submitted under penalty of perjury, this bill would expand the definition of a crime and thus impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003. However, because action occurred on the measure, the summary has been expanded.)Amends the Government Code to authorize the Board of Justice of the State of California to grant for loss, when it determines it will best aid the person seeking compensation reimbursement of the amount of outpatient psychiatric, psychological, or other mental health counseling-related expenses incurred the victim or derivative victim, including peer counseling services provided by violence peer counseling services provided by a service organization for victims of violent crime, and including family psychiatric, psychological, or mental health counseling for the successful treatment of the victim provided to family members of the victim in the presence of the victim, whether or not the family member relationship existed at the time of the crime, that became necessary as a direct result of the crime.Authorizes the following persons to be reimbursed for such expenses: (1) a victim of a crime of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor committed in violation of the Penal Code; (2) a victim of a crime of violence committed in violation of the Code; (3) a minor emotional injury as a direct result of witnessing a violent crime and who is not eligible for reimbursement of the costs of outpatient mental health counseling under any other provision of this"
"Existing law requires the owner or operator of a hazardous waste facility to submit hazardous waste facility closure and postclosure plans to the Department of Toxic Substances Control and to the California regional water quality control board for the region in which the facility is located. Existing law requires the department to review those plans and to approve a plan if it finds that the plan complies with the regulations adopted by the department and all other applicable state and federal regulations. Existing law requires the department to impose the requirements of a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan on the owner or operator of a facility through the issuance of a postclosure permit, or, only until January 1, 2009, through an enforcement order or an enforceable agreement, except as specified.
This bill would restore the authority of the department to impose those requirements through an enforcement order or an enforceable agreement and would require the department, on or before January 1, 2018, to adopt regulations to impose postclosure plan requirements.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 25247 of the Health and Safety Code proposed by AB 1611 and SB 839 that would become operative if this bill and one or both of those bills are enacted and this bill is chaptered last.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code, with respect to the approval of hazardous waste facility postclosure plans, to require the Department of Health and Safety to review each plan submitted and approve it if it finds that the plan complies with Department regulations and complies with all other applicable State and Federal regulations.

The bill defines ""immediate approval"" as the issuance of an enforcement order, entering into an enforceable agreement, or issuing a postclosure permit. A hazardous waste facility postclosure plan imposed or modified pursuant to an enforcement order, a permit, or an enforceable agreement shall be approved in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. Before the Department initially approves or significantly modifies a hazardous waste facility postclosure plan pursuant to this bill, it shall provide a meaningful opportunity for public involvement, including public notice and an opportunity for public comment.

"(1) Existing law, the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety and related statutes, requires that certain specified felonies be punished by a term of imprisonment in a county jail for 16 months, or 2 or 3 years, and provides for postrelease community supervision by county officials for persons convicted of certain specified felonies upon release from prison or county jail. As part of the realignment of public safety services to local agencies, existing law establishes the Local Revenue Fund 2011 into which specified tax revenues are deposited and are continuously appropriated for the provision of public safety services, as defined.
This bill, the 2015 Realignment Legislation addressing justice reinvestment, would establish the Realignment Reinvestment Fund in the State Treasury as a continuously appropriated fund. The bill would require the Director of Finance to annually calculate the net savings to the state for the prior fiscal year and an estimate of the net current fiscal year savings resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, as specified. The bill would require the Controller to transfer $1,300,000,000 from the General Fund to the Realignment Reinvestment Fund for the 2016–17 fiscal year, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would, beginning in the 2017–18 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, require the Controller to transfer an amount equal to the estimate of net current fiscal year savings resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, adjusted by the difference between the preceding year’s estimate and the calculated prior fiscal year net savings, thereby making an appropriation.
The bill would require the Controller to annually allocate moneys in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund, no later than September 1 of each year, to each county for deposit in the county’s Realignment Reinvestment Services Account proportionally, based on the average daily population of realigned offenders under each county’s supervision for the preceding fiscal year. The bill would require the Controller to consult with the Board of State and Community Corrections to determine the average daily population for each county.
The bill would require a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account to be established in each county treasury. The bill would require the moneys be used to implement a comprehensive, locally run, supplemental community-based corrections plan, as specified. The bill would require the supplemental community-based corrections plan to be developed by each county’s local Community Corrections Partnership and to be voted on by an executive committee of each county’s Community Corrections Partnership, as specified. The bill would deem the supplemental community-based corrections plan accepted by the county board of supervisors unless the board rejects the plan by a
4/5
vote. The bill would require each county or city and county to annually report to the county board of supervisors and the Board of State and Community Corrections on the programs funded pursuant to these provisions, as specified. By imposing additional duties on local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require the Director of Finance, in consultation with the Legislative Analyst, to develop a yearly estimate of the cost avoidances expected to be realized by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation that are a result of the 2011 Realignment Legislation and would require the director to report those estimates to the Legislature, as provided.
The bill would require that moneys allocated from a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account be expended exclusively for purposes of the bill’s provisions. The bill would require that funds received pursuant to its provisions be expended or encumbered no later than June 30 the following year and would require unspent moneys to be remitted for deposit in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
The California Emergency Services Act, among other things, establishes the Office of Emergency Services within the office of the Governor, under the charge of a Director of Emergency Services appointed by the Governor.

Realignment Legislation addressing justice reinvestment (Sec. 3) This bill establishes in the Treasury a Justice Reinvestment Fund to be used exclusively for the calculation of: the actual net savings to the state for the immediately preceding fiscal year resulting from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety, and an estimate of the net savings to the state for the current fiscal year resulting from such legislation. The Department of Finance shall use the same methodology to determine that the proposed 2016 budget for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is one billion three hundred million dollars less than the adjusted multiyear forecast for 2016, as reflected on page 30 of the report published by the Department of Finance and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in January 2016, entitled &quot;Realignment and any future savings, should be allocated to counties to mitigate the effects of the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety.&quot; Moneys in the Fund shall be allocated according to: the actual net savings to the state for the immediately preceding fiscal year resulting from such legislation; and an estimate of the net savings to the state for the current fiscal year resulting from such legislation."
"Existing law requires the Board of State and Community Corrections to collect and maintain available information and data about state and community correctional policies, practices, capacities, and needs, as specified. Existing law requires the board, in consultation with certain individuals, including a county supervisor or county administrative officer, a county sheriff, and the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, to develop definitions of specified key terms in order to facilitate consistency in local data collection, evaluation, and implementation of evidence-based programs.
This bill would enact the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2016. The bill would require the grant program to be administered by the Board of State and Community Corrections for the purpose of establishing and implementing reporting systems to identify and expand programs that provide proven, evidence-based, local programming opportunities for the successful reintegration of offenders into society.
The bill would authorize the board to award grants to assist counties with the creation or expansion of infrastructure that allows each county to consistently collect and report specified criminal justice information. The bill would require each local community corrections partnership, on or before June 1, 2016, to report to the board on the county’s capacity to collect and report the data required. The bill requires the board to review each assessment and to prioritize and award grants to the counties.
The bill would require each county to report specified data to the board, on or before January 1, 2017, and annually thereafter, pertaining to offenders sentenced as felons to serve in local correctional facilities and felons released from prison to community supervision. The bill would require the board to summarize these data and report the summaries to the Governor and the Legislature, on or before May 15, 2017, and annually thereafter.
By imposing data collection and reporting duties on local governments, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would appropriate an unspecified sum to the board for purposes of funding the grants. The bill would state findings and declarations of the Legislature regarding criminal justice realignment.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
The bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.
Existing law defines grand theft as the wrongful taking of money, labor, or property of a value exceeding $950, except as specified.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to that provision.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 2, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill requires the Board of State and Community Corrections to establish a Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program. Under the program, grants may be awarded for the establishment and implementation of reporting systems to identify and expand programs that provide proven evidence-based local programming opportunities for the successful reintegration of offenders into society, including programs that reduce criminal recidivism."
"Existing law establishes within the Department of Consumer Affairs a State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind, which is comprised of 7 members appointed by the Governor.
Existing law requires 2 of the board members to be persons who are blind or visually impaired who use guide dogs.
This bill would instead require at least 3 board members to be persons who are blind or visually impaired who use guide dogs.
Under existing law, the board has exclusive authority in this state to issue licenses for the instruction of persons who are blind or visually impaired in the use of guide dogs and for the training of guide dogs for use by persons who are blind or visually impaired. Under existing law, the board also has exclusive authority in this state to issue licenses to operate schools for the training of guide dogs and the instruction of persons who are blind or visually impaired in the use of guide dogs. Existing law makes it unlawful for any person to sell, offer for sale, give, hire, or furnish under any other arrangement, any guide dog or to engage in the business or occupation of training a guide dog unless he or she holds a valid and unimpaired license issued pursuant to the provisions governing guide dogs. A violation of those provisions is a crime.
This bill, whenever an individual has received training or instruction from a specified certified school outside of this state, would authorize personnel from that school to provide that individual with any followup services within this state with respect to the specific guide dog for whom training or instruction was originally provided outside of this state, as specified. The bill would require the personnel, not less than 3 days prior to arriving in this state, to notify the board of their intent to provide those services.
This bill would, if specified conditions are met, authorize followup emergency services. If those services are to be provided due to emergency circumstances, as determined by the school based on specified examples, the bill would authorize that notice to be provided within 24 hours after the personnel arrive in this state. The bill would prohibit the board from requiring the school to provide the name of the individual who will be receiving followup services, however, it would permit the board to require a school to provide the name of the individual to whom services have been provided to investigate personnel providing those services, so long as the investigation is based on reasonable grounds for determining that personnel may have provided substandard care. The bill would also authorize the board to refuse to allow personnel who have committed certain acts for which the board could suspend or revoke a license to provide those services, and would place those personnel under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the board while they provide those services. The bill, until January 1, 2018, would require the board to prepare a factsheet regarding various functions of the board, to post that factsheet on its Internet Web site, and to provide copies to each of the licensed guide dog schools. The bill, until January 1, 2018, would also require a licensed guide dog school to provide copies of the factsheet to every student receiving training from that school. Because the failure of a licensed guide dog school to provide those copies and the failure of personnel to provide that notification would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to establish, within the Department of Consumer Affairs, a State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind in California.

The bill would exempt from those taxes, on and after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2030, the gross receipts from the sale of, and the storage, use, or other consumption of, qualified tangible personal property purchased by a qualified person, as defined, for use primarily in, at, or on a marine terminal or qualified tangible personal property used primarily to maintain, repair, or test the above-described equipment, as provided.

The Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing law authorizes districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in conformity with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Exemptions from state sales and use taxes are incorporated into these laws.
This bill would specify that this exemption does not apply to local sales and use taxes, transactions and use taxes, and specified state taxes from which revenues are deposited into the Local Public Safety Fund, the Education Protection Account, the Local Revenue Fund, or the Local Revenue Fund 2011.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","Declares that, between January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2030, there shall be in effect in California a 50% tax on gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property purchased for use by a qualified person (defined as a person who is engaged in the operation of a port, rail ramp, yard, or other public freight facility and who is engaged in freight delivery, or a person who is engaged in storage or storage of tangible property within California) that is used primarily at a port or seaport, or on a marine terminal of a city or railroad, for cargo handling, or movement of freight, and that is purchased for use primarily by a qualified person using tangible property at a port or seaport, or by a retailer using tangible property at a port or seaport. Defines &quot;qualified person&quot; as a person that is stedore of marine terminal, rail ramp, rail yard, or freight delivery facility within a public freight facility, or any other person engaged in freight delivery, or storage of tangible property within California and that includes all qualified zeroemission personal equipment or computer software required for purposes of such tax."
"Existing law provides for the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program under which, through a combination of state and county funds and federal funds received through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families.
Existing law establishes the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income persons are provided with health care services.
Existing law establishes a statewide program to enable eligible low-income persons to receive food stamps under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known in California as CalFresh. Existing law requires counties to implement the program, including determining eligibility and distributing CalFresh benefits. Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish and implement a process of intercounty transfer of eligibility for CalFresh benefits, and to take various regulatory actions.
Existing law requires the county where an applicant of a public assistance program lives to be responsible for paying for the aid and requires transfer of the responsibility to pay, when that person moves to another county, to the 2nd county as soon as administratively possible, but not later than the first day of the month following 30 days after notification to the 2nd county.
This bill would instead, commencing June 1, 2017, require the responsibility for payment of aid to transfer to the 2nd county as soon as administratively possible, as specified. The bill would delete provisions relating to the determination of the county of residence for an aid recipient who has been released or discharged from a state hospital.
Under existing law, a recipient of aid who is changing residence from one county to another within the state is required to notify the county paying aid to the recipient of the move, and to apply for a redetermination of eligibility within the new county of residence. Existing law imposes various requirements on the relevant counties, including requiring the county to which the recipient has moved to determine the recipient’s continued eligibility for payment of aid and, to the extent possible, the recipient’s eligibility for the Medi-Cal program.
This bill would make inoperative on June 1, 2017, those provisions relating to the notice and redetermination of aid procedures for when a recipient of aid changes residence from one county to another within the state, including the procedures for intercounty transfer of CalFresh benefits. The bill would instead, commencing June 1, 2017, require the recipient to notify either the county from which he or she moves or the county to which he or she moves of the change of residence and, within 7 business days of notice of a new residence, would require that county to initiate an intercounty transfer for specified public social service benefits. The bill would require that the benefits be transferred no later than the first day of the next available benefit month following 30 days after a county was notified. The bill would prohibit the new county of residence from interviewing recipients from another county to determine continued eligibility for the CalWORKs or CalFresh programs until the next scheduled recertification or redetermination, and would require case file documents to be shared electronically between the prior county of residence and the new county of residence. The bill would require the State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Social Services to adopt regulations by July 1, 2021. The bill would require, beginning June 1, 2017, the departments to provide a status report on the adoption of the regulations to the Legislature on a semiannual basis. Because this bill would impose additional duties on counties with regard to the provision of aid, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code, with respect to changing residence from one county to another, to require a recipient of aid pursuant to specified provisions of title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to notify either the county from which he or she moves or the county to which he or she moves with the option to report a change of residence in person, telephonically, or electronically online at the time of application and redetermination or recertification. Within seven business days of notice of a new residence, the notified county shall initiate an intercounty transfer for all benefits under this division that the recipient is receiving, and benefits shall be transferred no later than the first day of the next available benefit month following 30 days after a county was notified. The process shall ensure that the applicant or recipient does not need to provide copies of documents that were previously provided to the prior county of residence. Case file documents shall be electronically shared between the prior county and the new county, to the extent possible. The new county shall not interview recipients moving to that county from another county to determine continued eligibility for CalFresh or CalWORKs until the next scheduled redetermination or recertification. This bill shall not preclude the new county of residence from interviewing CalWORKs recipients regarding welfare-to-work"
"Existing law, as amended by Proposition 9, the Victim’s Bill of Rights Act of 2008: Marsy’s Law, at the November 4, 2008, statewide general election, authorizes the Board of Parole Hearings, after considering the views and interests of the victim, to advance a parole hearing that was set after a hearing at which parole was denied to an earlier date when a change in circumstances or new information establishes a reasonable likelihood that consideration of the public and victim’s safety does not require the prisoner to serve the additional period of incarceration required as a result of the previously set hearing date. Marsy’s Law authorizes the Legislature to amend its provisions by passing a statute with
3/4
of the membership of each house concurring, unless the amendments expand the scope of Marsy’s Law’s provisions, recognize additional rights of crime victims, or further the rights of crime victims, in which case the Legislature may amend its provisions by passing a statute with a majority vote of membership of each house concurring.
This bill would prohibit the board from advancing a parole hearing to a date less than 2 years after a hearing at which parole was denied.","Requires: (1) at least ten days before any hearing by the Board of Parole Hearings, the inmate to review the file which will be examined by the board and to have the opportunity to enter a written response; (2) the inmate to be present, to ask and answer questions, and to speak on his or her own behalf; (3) unless legal counsel is required, a person designated by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to ensure that all facts relevant to the decision be presented; (4) the inmate and any person described in specified provisions to request and receive a stenographic record of all proceedings; and (5) the board to set a date to reconsider whether an inmate should be released on parole that ensures a meaningful consideration of whether the inmate is suitable for release on parole. <n>Requires the board: (1) within ten days following any decision granting parole, to send the inmate a written statement setting forth the reason or reasons for granting parole, the conditions he or she must meet in order to be released, and the consequences of failure to meet those conditions; (2) within 20 days following any decision denying parole, to send the inmate a written statement setting forth such reasons for denying parole, and suggesting activities in which he or she might participate that will benefit him or her; and (3) to schedule the"
"Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary education in this state. Existing law establishes school districts throughout the state and authorizes these school districts to provide instruction at the elementary and secondary schools they operate and maintain. Existing law provides for the governance of these school districts through elected school district governing boards.
This bill would authorize school district governing boards to transfer to another school in that school district pupils enrolled in that school district who have been convicted of violent felonies, as defined, or designated misdemeanors if the pupil to be transferred and the victim of the crime for which the pupil was convicted are enrolled at the same school, if certain requirements are satisfied, including, but not limited to, that the governing board of the school district adopts a policy and notifies parents or guardians of the policy as part of its annual notification to parents and guardians, as specified.","Amends the Education Code to allow the governing board of a school district to transfer a pupil convicted of a violent felony or a misdemeanor to another school in that school district if the pupil and the victim of the crime are enrolled at the same school, subject to specified conditions. <n>Requires the governing board of each school district to notify the parent or guardian of a minor pupil regarding: (1) the right or responsibility of the parent or guardian regarding the right or responsibility of the parent or guardian under specified provisions of the Education Code; (2) the availability of individualized instruction; (3) the availability of pupil-free staff development days; and (4) the importance of investing for future college or university education for their children and of considering appropriate investment options, including United States savings bonds. <n>Requires such notification to advise the parent or guardian of the pupil that each pupil completing grade 12 is required to successfully pass the high school exit examination administered pursuant to specified provisions of the Education Code.

"Existing law authorizes an off-highway motor vehicle that has been issued a plate or device to be operated or driven upon a highway under certain circumstances. Existing law authorizes various public entities, and the Director of Parks and Recreation, to designate a highway, or portion thereof, for the combined use of regular vehicular traffic and off-highway motor vehicles if certain requirements are met. Existing law prohibits a highway from being designated for this combined use for a distance of more than 3 miles.
Existing law, until January 1, 2017, authorizes the County of Inyo to establish a pilot project that would exempt specified combined-use highways in the unincorporated area in the County of Inyo from this prohibition to link together existing roads in the unincorporated portion of the county to existing trails and trailheads on federal Bureau of Land Management or United States Forest Service lands in order to provide a unified linkage of trail systems for off-highway motor vehicles, as prescribed. Existing law requires the County of Inyo, in consultation with the Department of the California Highway Patrol, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Parks and Recreation, to prepare and submit to the Legislature a report evaluating the effectiveness of the pilot project by January 1, 2016, as specified.
This bill would extend the operation of these provisions until January 1, 2020, and would extend the reporting deadline until January 1, 2019. For purposes of the pilot project described above, the bill would prohibit a combined-use highway road segment from exceeding 10 miles, except as specified.","This bill authorizes Inyo County to establish a pilot project to designate combined-use highways on unincorporated county roads for no more than 10 miles so that the combined-use highways can be used to link existing off-highway motor vehicle trails and trailheads on Federal Bureau of Land Management or United States Forest Service lands and to link off-highway motor vehicle recreational-use areas with necessary service and lodging facilities. A pilot project shall do all of the following: prescribe a procedure for highway, road, or route selection and designation; prescribe a procedure for the county to remove a combined-use designation; establish uniform specifications and symbols for signs, markers, and traffic control devices to control off-highway motor vehicles; prohibit off-highway motor vehicles from traveling faster than 35 miles per hour on designated highways; include an opportunity for public comment at a public hearing; and include the use of a state highway, subject to Department of Transportation approval."
"Existing law establishes the California Land Conservation Act of 1965, otherwise known as the Williamson Act, and authorizes a city or county to enter into 10-year contracts with owners of land devoted to agricultural use, whereby the owners agree to continue using the property for that purpose, and the city or county agrees to value the land accordingly for purposes of property taxation, as specified. Existing law provides a procedure to cancel a contract entered into under these provisions, and provides that the landowner and the Department of Conservation may agree on the cancellation value of the land.
Existing law requires cancellation fees, when they are required to be collected, to be transmitted by the county treasurer to the Controller and deposited in the General Fund, except the first $2,536,000 of revenue paid to the Controller in the 2004–05 fiscal year, and any amount approved in the final Budget Act for each fiscal year thereafter, is required to be deposited in the Soil Conservation Fund, and as otherwise specified. Existing law provides that the money in the Soil Conservation Fund is available, when appropriated by the Legislature, for specified programs and administrative costs.
This bill would provide that the money in the Soil Conservation Fund is available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, additionally for competitive grants and financial assistance to resource conservation districts to aid in the implementation of state programs or projects that improve soil conservation, carbon sequestration in soil, or moisture retention in soil, or other types of projects that improve the quality of agricultural and related land resources, subject to a specified condition. The bill would require the Department of Conservation to establish this competitive grant program.
Existing law requires the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection to establish a fire prevention fee in an amount not to exceed $150 to be charged on each habitable structure on a parcel that is within a state responsibility area. Existing law requires the fee moneys to be expended, upon appropriation, in specified ways, including to reimburse the State Board of Equalization’s expenses incurred in the collection of the fee and to the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection and to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection for administration purposes, with excess money being expended only for specified fire prevention activities, as provided.
Existing law, until January 31, 2017, requires the board to submit an annual written report to the Legislature on the status of the uses of the fee moneys.
This bill would continue that requirement until January 31, 2022.","Requires, prior to any action by the board or council giving tentative approval to the cancellation of any contract, the county assessor of the county in which the land is located to: (1) determine the current fair market value of the land as though it were free of the contractual restriction; and (2) certify to the board or council the cancellation valuation of the land for the purpose of determining the cancellation fee. Requires the board or council, prior to giving tentative approval to the cancellation of any contract, to determine and certify to the county auditor the amount of the cancellation fee that the landowner shall pay the county treasurer upon cancellation. Provides that if it finds that it is in the public interest to do so, the board or council may waive any payment or any portion of a payment by the landowner, or may extend the time for making the payment contingent upon the future use made of the land and its economic return to the landowner for a period of time not to exceed the unexpired period of the contract, had it not been canceled, if all of the following occur: the cancellation is caused by an involuntary transfer or change in the use which may be made of the land and the land is not immediately suitable, nor will be immediately used, for a purpose which produces a greater economic return"
"The Political Reform Act of 1974 generally requires elected officials, candidates for elective office, and committees formed primarily to support or oppose a candidate for public office or a ballot measure, along with other entities, to file periodic campaign statements. The act requires that these campaign statements contain prescribed information related to campaign contributions and expenditures of the filing entities. Existing law, the Online Disclosure Act, requires the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Fair Political Practices Commission, to develop online and electronic filing processes for use by these persons and entities.
This bill, in addition, would require the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Commission, to develop and certify for public use an online filing and disclosure system for campaign statements and reports that provides public disclosure of campaign finance and lobbying information in a user-friendly, easily understandable format.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.","(Sec. 2) Directs the Secretary to do all of the following: (1) develop online and electronic filing processes for use by persons and entities required to file statements and reports with the Secretary of State's office pursuant to provisions relating to voluntary, mandatory, and other disclosure of campaign finance and lobbying information; and (2) provide sufficient technology to seek to prevent unauthorized alteration or manipulation of the data transmitted and to archive such data in an easily understood format that provides the greatest public access to it. Requires the data made available on the Internet to include an examination of system security, private security issues, software availability, compliance costs to filers, use of the filing system and software provided by the Secretary, and recommend appropriate changes if necessary."

The program prohibits an applicant from receiving one or a combination of program awards in excess of the amount equivalent to the award level for a total of a 4-year period of full-time attendance in an undergraduate program, except as provided.
This bill would increase this generally applicable maximum for total Cal Grant awards to an applicant to the award level for a 6-year period of full-time attendance.
Existing law establishes the Student Aid Commission as the primary state agency for the administration of state-authorized student financial aid programs available to students attending segments of postsecondary education.
This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would make additional student financial aid options available for students attending segments of postsecondary education.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 19, 2016.

"The California Ocean Protection Act establishes the Ocean Protection Council and requires the council, among other things, to coordinate activities of state agencies that are related to the protection and conservation of coastal waters and ocean ecosystems, and to establish policies to coordinate the collection and sharing of scientific data related to coastal and ocean resources among agencies. The act creates the California Ocean Protection Trust Fund in the State Treasury and authorizes moneys deposited in the fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be expended by the council for projects and activities authorized by the council consistent with the purposes of the act.
This bill would require the council, in consultation with the State Coastal Conservancy and other relevant entities, to establish and administer the Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Reduction Program for the purposes of achieving specified goals. The bill would authorize moneys in the trust fund to be expended for grants or loans for projects or activities that further public purposes consistent with the Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Reduction Program.","This bill amends the Public Resources Code to require the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)to establish and administer the Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Reduction Program to remove carbon dioxide from ocean acidification and mitigate hypoxia.The program must include: (1) demonstration projects, (2) inventorying locations where conservation or restoration of aquatic habitats can be successfully applied to mitigate ocean acidification and hypoxia, (3) consideration of carbon dioxide removal for habitat restoration, (4) supporting science, monitoring, and coordination to ensure that ocean acidification and hypoxia reflect best readily available science on strategies to reduce ocean acidification and hypoxia, and (5) developing strategies that increase environmental and economic allocation and collaboration with fishery participants."
"(1) Existing law requires each county to provide cash assistance and other social services to needy families through the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program using federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant program, state, and county funds. Existing law generally requires a recipient of CalWORKs benefits to participate in welfare-to-work activities as a condition of eligibility for aid. Existing law requires that necessary supportive services be available to participants in welfare-to-work activities, including transportation costs and ancillary expenses, which include the cost of books, as provided in the welfare-to-work plan entered into between the county and the participant.
This bill would require that a standard allowance for transportation costs be advanced to a participant at the beginning of each month
in an amount that is equal to the cost of a monthly pass for the county public transit system, or if a county does not have a public transit system,
in the amount of $100 per month. The bill would also require that a participant who has been assigned to an educational activity in a postsecondary school
full time, as defined by the school,
receive a standard allowance of $500 for books and supplies,
or $250 if the participant has been assigned to an educational activity part time, as defined by the school,
adjusted annually as
specified,
specified. The bill would require the educational allowance to be paid
at least 15 days before the start of the semester. The bill would authorize the participant to opt out of these standard allowances at any time and make a reimbursement claim for actual costs, and to submit this claim to the county by mail, in person,
or
or, if the county already has the technological capacity to do so,
via the county’s Internet Web site. By increasing the duties of counties administering these services, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Makes necessary supportive services available to every participant in order to participate in the program activity to which he or she is assigned or to accept employment or the participant shall have good cause for not participating under specified provisions of title XI of the Welfare and Institutions Act. <n>Includes paid child care, necessary child care services, parent fees, and transportation costs as necessary supportive services to every participant with a dependent child in the assistance unit who needs paid child care if the child is ten years of age or under, or requires child care or supervision due to a physical, mental, or developmental disability or other similar condition as verified by the county welfare department, or who is under court supervision. <n>Makes necessary child care services available to every former recipient for up to two years, pursuant to provisions of title 1 of Division 1 of the Education Code. <n>Makes necessary child care services available to every participant with a dependent child in the assistance unit who needs paid child care if the child is 11 or 12 years of age. <n>Deems a child in foster care receiving benefits under Title IV-E of the Federal Social Security Act or a child who would become a dependent child except for the receipt of federal Security Income benefits to be a dependent child for purposes of this Act.

"Existing law, the Sex Equity in Education Act, states the policy of the state that elementary and secondary school classes and courses, including nonacademic and elective classes and courses, be conducted without regard to the sex of the pupil enrolled in these classes or courses. Existing federal law, known as Title IX, prohibits a person, on the basis of sex, from being excluded from participation in, being denied the benefits of, or being subject to discrimination under, any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
This bill would require, on or before July 1, 2017, all public schools, private schools that receive federal funds and are subject to the requirements of Title IX, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to post in a prominent and conspicuous location on their Internet Web sites specified information relating to Title IX. The bill would require the Superintendent of Public Instruction to annually send a letter through electronic means to all public schools, private schools that receive federal funds and are subject to the requirements of Title IX, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools informing them of the new requirement that would be created by this bill and of their responsibilities under Title IX. Because the bill would impose additional duties on public schools, school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill requires all public schools, private schools, county offices of education, and charter schools in California to post in a prominent and conspicuous location on their websites: the name and contact information of the Title IX coordinator of that school or district, the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, and the county office of education or charter school; the rights of a pupil and the public and the office's responsibilities; and a link to the Office for Civil Rights website."
"Existing law establishes various programs, including, among others, the Emergency Housing and Assistance Program, to provide assistance to homeless persons.
This bill would require a state agency or department that funds, implements, or administers a state program that provides housing or housing-related services to people experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, except as specified, to revise or adopt guidelines and regulations to include enumerated Housing First policies. The bill would also establish the Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council to oversee the implementation of the Housing First guidelines and regulations and, among other things, to identify resources, benefits, and services that can be accessed to prevent and end homelessness in California.",(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Amends the Welfare Institutions Act to establish: (1) the Housing First Coordinating and Coordinating Council within the Department of Housing and Community Development; and (2) the Homeless Financing Council within the Department of Health Services.

The bill would provide that, commencing with the 2017–18 school year, and each school year thereafter, a full-time, credentialed teacher who has completed his or her first school year of full-time teaching as of the end of that school year would receive a grant of $1,000 during the next school year. The bill would provide that, commencing with the 2018–19 school year, and each school year thereafter, a full-time, credentialed teacher who has completed 2 school years of full-time teaching as of the end of that school year would receive a grant of $1,000 during the next school year. The bill would further provide that, commencing with the 2019–20 school year, and each school year thereafter, a full-time, credentialed teacher who has completed 3 school years of full-time teaching as of the end of that school year would receive a grant of $2,500 during the next school year. The bill would also provide that, commencing with the 2020–21 school year, and each school year thereafter, a full-time, credentialed teacher who has completed 4 school years of full-time teaching as of the end of that school year would receive a grant of $2,500 during the next school year.

The bill would require the department to submit a report to the Legislature on or before July 1, 2022, on the effectiveness of the grant program.
The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law.
This bill would, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, allow a credit under the Personal Income Tax Law in an amount equal to $5,000 to a qualified taxpayer, as defined to include specified full-time teachers. This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to provide that the credit amount in excess of tax liability would be refundable in those years in which an appropriation for that purpose is made by the Legislature and includes findings relating to that appropriation.

(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Department of Education (ED) to award competitive grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) to provide subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for specified activities related to teacher preparation for full-time teaching in elementary and secondary schools. The grants may be used for: professional development for teachers who have completed at least five years of teaching service in elementary or secondary schools and at least five years of teaching service in an IHE; recruitment and retention of highly qualified teachers who agree to teach in schools with high concentrations of students from low-income families; professional development designed to prepare teachers to teach at the next level; and other activities determined by ED to be reasonably necessary to carry out this Act. Additionally, ED may award grants to IHEs to provide scholarships for students who have completed at least five years of teaching service in elementary or secondary schools and at least five years of teaching service at the next level to schools with high concentrations of students from low-income families."
"(1) The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The state board is required to approve a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020. The state board is also required to complete a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, as defined, in the state.
This bill would require the state board, no later than January 1, 2018, to approve and begin implementing that comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants to achieve a reduction in methane by 40%, hydrofluorocarbon gases by 40%, and anthropogenic black carbon by 50% below 2013 levels by 2030, as specified. The bill also would establish specified targets for reducing organic waste in landfills.
This bill would require the state board, in consultation with the Department of Food and Agriculture, to adopt regulations to reduce methane emissions from livestock manure management operations and dairy manure management operations, as specified. The bill would require the state board to take certain actions prior to adopting those regulations. This bill would require the regulations to take effect on or after January 1, 2024, if the state board, in consultation with the department, makes certain determinations.
This bill would require the state board, the Public Utilities Commission, and the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to undertake various actions related to reducing short-lived climate pollutants in the state. The bill would require state agencies to consider and, as appropriate, adopt policies and incentives to significantly increase the sustainable production and use of renewable gas.
(2) The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, which is administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, establishes an integrated waste management program that requires each county and city and county to prepare and submit to the department a countywide integrated waste management plan.
The bill would require the department, in consultation with the state board, to adopt regulations that achieve the specified targets for reducing organic waste in landfills. The bill would authorize local jurisdictions to charge and collect fees to recover the local jurisdiction’s costs incurred in complying with the regulations. The bill would require, no later than July 1, 2020, the department, in consultation with the state board, to analyze the progress that the waste sector, state government, and local governments have made in achieving the specified targets for reducing organic waste in landfills. The bill would authorize the department, depending on the outcome of that analysis, to amend the regulations to include incentives or additional requirements, as specified. By adding to the duties of local governments related to organic waste in landfills, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires the State of California to develop a strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, such as black carbon, fluorinated gases, and methane, from livestock operations and dairy manure management operations. The strategy must include goals for reducing those emissions below 2013 levels by 2030."
"Existing law requires the electronic recording of the entire custodial interrogation of a minor who is in a fixed place of detention, as defined, and who, at the time of the interrogation, is suspected of committing or accused of committing murder. Existing law sets forth various exceptions from this requirement, including if the law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation or his or her superior reasonably believes that electronic recording would disclose the identity of a confidential informant or jeopardize the safety of an officer, the individual being interrogated, or another individual. Existing law requires the prosecution to show by clear and convincing evidence that an exception applies to justify the failure to make that electronic recording. Existing law requires the interrogating entity to maintain the original or an exact copy of an electronic recording made of the interrogation until the final conclusion of the proceedings, as specified. Existing law additionally requires the court to provide jury instructions developed by the Judicial Council if the court finds that a defendant was subjected to a custodial interrogation in violation of the above-mentioned provisions.
This bill would make this electronic recording requirement applicable to the custodial interrogation of any person suspected of committing murder. By imposing new requirements on local law enforcement, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would exempt from the electronic recording requirement the interrogation of a person who is in custody on a charge of murder if the interrogation is not related to the commission of murder, as specified.
Existing law defines “electronic recording” for these provisions as a video recording that accurately records a custodial interrogation.
This bill would specify that the above definition applies only to the custodial interrogation of a minor. The bill would expand the definition to include a video or audio recording in the case of the custodial interrogation of an adult and would express the Legislature’s encouragement that law enforcement agencies use video recording when available.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to the above provisions.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Declares that it is the intent of the Legislature to require electronic recording of both adults and juveniles interrogated in fixed place of detention and suspected of committing murder, except that under specified circumstances an electronic recording shall be required.(Sec. 2) Amends the Federal criminal code to require that a statement that is electronically recorded that occurs from rebuttable processing of the equipment and timely maintenance of law enforcement personnel and the person informants responsive statements were part of a documented custodial interrogation, but shall not apply under any circumstances being that individual being interrogated by another law enforcement officer may have committed murder.Directs that if an individual being interrogated is not electronically recorded, continued interrogation shall be electronically recorded if the officer refuses to create or disclose an electronic recording of the entire interrogation.Requires the officer, if the person being interrogated was conducted by another law enforcement officer, to document any coercive interrogation in writing if the person being interrogated was conducted by no confidential law enforcement personnel and the person informants responsive statements were part of a documented custodial interrogation, but shall not apply under any circumstances being that individual being interrogated by another law enforcement officer may have committed murder."
"Existing law, the Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement (STAKE) Act, imposes civil penalties for a person engaged in the retail sale of tobacco products who sells, offers for sale, or displays for sale any tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia by self-service display, except as specified. Existing law makes these penalties inapplicable to the display in a tobacco store of cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, or dipping tobacco, as provided, and defines “tobacco store” to mean a retail business that meets specified requirements, including that it does not permit any person under 18 years of age to be present or enter the premises at any time, unless accompanied by the person’s parent or legal guardian.
This bill would revise the definition of “tobacco store” by raising the age of persons not permitted to be present or enter the premises at any time, unless accompanied by the person’s parent or legal guardian, from 18 to 21 years of age.
Existing law, the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Licensing Act of 2003, requires a retailer to obtain a license from the State Board of Equalization to engage in the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products in this state and defines a retailer as a person who engages in this state in the sale of cigarettes or tobacco products directly to the public from a retail location. The act defines a “retail location” as both any building from which cigarettes or tobacco products are sold at retail and a vending machine.
The act also defines “tobacco products” to include, but not be limited to, all forms of cigars, smoking tobacco, chewing tobacco, snuff, and any other articles or products made of, or containing at least 50%
, tobacco, but does not include cigarettes. A violation of these provisions is a crime.
This bill
would,
would expand the definition of “tobacco products” to include a product containing, made, or derived from tobacco or nicotine, as specified, an electronic device that delivers nicotine or other vaporized liquids to the person inhaling from the device, and any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product. The bill would,
beginning January 1, 2019, revise the definition of a “retail location” to mean a tobacco store that is a retail business that, among other things, generates more than 60% of its gross revenues annually from the sale of tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia.
By expanding the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Makes it unlawful for a person to sell, offer for sale, or display for sale any tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia by self-service display in a tobacco store, unless such product is generally not sold or offered for sale in a sealed package containing less than six cigars. Makes it unlawful for a person engaged in the retail sale of blunt wraps to place or maintain, or to cause to be placed or maintained, any blunt wrap advertising display within two feet of candy, snack, or nonalcoholic beverage displayed inside any store or business. Makes it unlawful for any person or business to place or maintain, or cause to be placed or maintained, any blunt wrap advertising display that is less than four feet above the floor. Exempts from such prohibitions any tobacco store of cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, or tobacco, provided that in the case of cigars they are generally not sold or offered for sale in a sealed package of the manufacturer or importer containing less than six cigars."
"Existing law provides that individuals with disabilities or medical conditions have the same right as the general public to the full and free use of the streets, highways, sidewalks, walkways, public buildings, medical facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and physicians’ offices, public facilities, and other public places. Existing law requires an attorney who provides a demand letter or sends or serves a complaint containing a claim of a violation of any construction-related accessibility standard, as defined, with respect to a place of public accommodation, to send a copy of the demand letter or complaint to the California Commission on Disability Access within 5 business days of providing the demand letter or sending or serving the complaint. Existing law further requires an attorney who sends or serves that complaint to notify the commission of judgment, settlement, or dismissal of the claim or claims alleged in the complaint and other specified information within 5 business days of the judgment, settlement, or dismissal.
This bill, with specified exceptions, would also require an attorney who provides a prelitigation letter or sends or serves a complaint alleging a construction-related accessibility claim, as defined, against an education entity, as defined, to send a copy of the prelitigation letter or complaint to the commission within 5 business days of providing the prelitigation letter or sending or serving the complaint, would require the attorney to also submit information about the complaint with the copy of the complaint, and would further require the attorney to submit the notification of judgment, settlement, or dismissal to the commission, as described above. The bill would subject an attorney who fails to comply with these requirements to discipline and would require the commission to review and report on the prelitigation letters, complaints, and notifications of case outcomes the commission receives pursuant to these requirements, as specified.","Amends the Civil Code to require attorneys who provide prelitigation services to send a copy of the prelitigation letter to the California Commission on Disability Access within five business days of serving or sending the complaint. Requires the attorney also to notify the Commission within five business days of judgment, settlement, or dismissal of the claim or claims alleged in the complaint of: (1) whether or not the construction-related accessibility violations alleged in the complaint were remedied in whole or in part after the plaintiff filed a complaint; and (2) if the construction-related accessibility violations alleged in the complaint were not remedied in whole or in part after the plaintiff filed the complaint, whether or not another favorable result was achieved after the plaintiff filed the complaint. Prohibits an attorney from being required to send a copy of any subsequent prelitigation letter or amended complaint in the same following dispute following a prelitigation letter or complaint, unless the subsequent letter or amended complaint alleges a new construction-related accessibility claim. Requires the Commission to review and report on such prelitigation letters, complaints, and notifications in the same manner as provided under the Government Code."
"Existing law authorizes the Treasurer or chief fiscal officer of a campus of the California State University to invest certain money received by the California State University in eligible securities and in investment certificates or withdrawal shares in federal or state credit unions doing business in this state as long as any money invested in this manner is fully insured by the National Credit Union Administration.
This bill would authorize the Treasurer or chief fiscal officer of a campus of the California State University to invest that money in mutual funds subject to registration by, and under the regulatory authority of, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or in United States registered real estate investment trusts. The bill would impose specified requirements on the Trustees of the California State University relating to those types of investments.
Existing law establishes the California State University Special Projects Fund, which consists of grants, revenues, and funds that are appropriated for the operation, support, and development of research, workshops, conferences, institutes, and special projects in the California State University. Existing law authorizes the Treasurer to invest money from the fund in eligible securities.
This bill would authorize the Treasurer or chief fiscal officer of a campus of the California State University to invest the money in the California State University Special Projects Fund in mutual funds subject to registration by, and under the regulatory authority of, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or in United States registered real estate investment trusts. Because the bill would authorize the expenditure of moneys from a continuously appropriated fund for new purposes, it would make an appropriation.
This bill would limit the total amount invested in these mutual funds and real estate investment trusts to specified amounts for each fiscal year, until, commencing with the 2019–20 fiscal year, up to 30% of that money could be invested in these asset categories. The bill would prohibit increases in tuition or reductions in course section offerings from being adopted because of investment losses sustained as a result of these provisions.","Amends the Education Code of 1965 to revise specified requirements for the support of the California State University with respect to money received from the sale of university publications, student fees, and gifts and donations. Appropriates all such money for the support of the University without regard to fiscal year. Requires all such money to be used for: (1) student scholarships and loans; (2) funds received from the sale of university publications; and (3) money collected as fees from students and received from other persons. Authorizes the investment of such money, upon approval of the trustees of the University, in eligible securities listed in the Government Code. Requires all interest and other earnings received pursuant to such investment to be used for purposes established by the trustees consistent with the terms and conditions of the gift, bequest, devise, donation, or agreement. Declares that all money received shall augment the support appropriation to the University for the fiscal year to which the collections apply. Appropriates all money received from the sale or disposition of real property acquired by or on behalf of a campus of the University by gift, bequest, or donation for capital outlay for the acquisition and improvement of real property for the campus."
"Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission) to prescribe, by regulation, building design and construction standards and energy and water conservation design standards for new residential and nonresidential buildings. Existing law requires the Energy Commission to prescribe, by regulation, standards for minimum levels of operating efficiency to promote the use of energy-efficient and water-efficient appliances whose use requires a significant amount of energy or water on a statewide basis. Existing law requires that the minimum levels of operating efficiency be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies or feasible improved efficiencies that will reduce the energy or water consumption growth rates. Existing law prohibits a new appliance manufactured on or after the effective date of the operating efficiency standards to be sold or offered for sale in the state unless it is certified by the manufacturer to be in compliance with those standards.
This bill would require the Energy Commission, by January 1, 2019, to approve a plan that will promote compliance with specified regulations in the installation of central air conditioning and heat pumps. The bill would authorize the Energy Commission to adopt regulations to increase compliance with permitting and inspection requirements for central air conditioning and heat pumps, and associated sales and installations, consistent with that plan.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. The Reliable Electric Service Investments Act states the intent of the Legislature that the Public Utilities Commission continue to administer cost-effective energy efficiency programs that produce cost-effective energy savings, reduce customer demand, and contribute to the safe and reliable operation of the electrical distribution grid. Under the act, in order to receive a rebate or incentive offered by a public utility for an energy efficiency improvement or for the installation of energy efficient components, equipment, or appliances in buildings, the recipient is required to certify that the improvement or installation complied with any applicable permitting requirements and, if a contractor performed the installation or improvement, that the contractor holds the appropriate license for the work performed.
This bill would limit the application of the above energy efficiency rebate and incentive provisions to customer or contractor recipients. The bill would require a customer or contractor to certify that an energy efficiency improvement or installation complies with any applicable specifications or requirements set forth in the California Building Standards Code in order to receive a rebate or incentive. The bill would require a customer or contractor receiving a rebate or incentive offered by a public utility for purchasing or installing central air conditioning or a heat pump, and their related fans, to additionally provide a proof of permit closure. The bill would also more specifically identify the Public Utility Commission’s statutory authority for supervising cost-effective energy efficiency programs.","This bill requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to approve before January 1, 2019, a plan that will promote compliance with state permitting and inspection requirements for the installation of central air-conditioning and heat pumps. Prior to approving such plan, FERC must: evaluate the best available technological and economic information to ensure that data collection and its use is feasible and achievable at a reasonable cost to government, industry, and homeowners; consider the impact of the plan on property owners, the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning industry, and local governments; and provide the opportunity to review and comment on the proposed plan. FERC may adopt regulations to increase compliance with permitting and inspection requirements for central air-conditioning and heat pumps and associated sales and installations consistent with the proposed plan. The bill amends the Public Utilities Code to state that it is the policy of California to require FERC to supervise the administration of cost-effective energy efficiency programs in order to ensure that prudent investments in energy efficiency continue to be made that produce cost-effective energy savings, reduce customer demand, and contribute to the safe and reliable operation of the electrical distribution grid. If a customer or contractor is the recipient of a rebate or incentive offered by a public utility for an energy efficiency improvement or installation of energy efficient components, equipment,"
"Existing law authorizes an individual taxpayer to contribute amounts in excess of his or her personal income tax liability for the support of specified funds. Existing law also contains administrative provisions that are generally applicable to voluntary contributions.
This bill would allow an individual to designate on his or her tax return that a specified amount in excess of his or her tax liability be transferred to the Revive the Salton Sea Fund, which would be created by this bill. The bill would prohibit a voluntary contribution designation for the Revive the Salton Sea Fund from being added on the tax return until another voluntary contribution designation is removed or a space is available and would require, once the designation is added, specified information to be on the tax form, including the purposes for which the contribution would be used.
This bill would require money contributed to the fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller for reimbursement of costs, as provided, and to the Natural Resources Agency for distribution of competitive grants to provide funds or supplement funding of the state, county and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, and projects identified as necessary for the restoration and maintenance of the Salton Sea and to develop a mechanism to provide ongoing public awareness, as specified.
The bill would provide that these provisions would remain in effect only until January 1 of the 5th taxable year following the first appearance of the fund on the tax return, but would further provide for an earlier repeal if the Franchise Tax Board determines that the amount of contributions estimated to be received during a calendar year will not equal or exceed the minimum contribution amount, as defined, for that calendar year, in which case these provisions would be repealed on December 1 of that year.","Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to allow an individual to designate on a tax return that a contribution in excess of the individual tax liability be made to the Revive the Salton Sea Fund, which shall be used for restoration of the Salton Sea. Establishes in the State Treasury the Revive the Salton Sea Fund to receive contributions made pursuant to California agencies, nonprofit organizations, and projects identified as necessary for the restoration and maintenance of the Salton Sea, including projects identified by the Salton Sea Authority. Allows a tax deduction for contributions to the Fund."
"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. The federal Medicaid program provisions prohibit payment to a state for medical assistance furnished to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law.
This bill would extend eligibility for full-scope Medi-Cal benefits to individuals 19 years of age and older who are otherwise eligible for those benefits but for their immigration status if the department determines that sufficient funding is available, or for limited scope Medi-Cal benefits if funding for full-scope benefits is not available. The bill would require these individuals to enroll into Medi-Cal managed care health plans, and to pay copayments and premium contributions, to the extent required of otherwise eligible Medi-Cal recipients who are similarly situated. The bill would require that benefits for those services to be provided with state-only funds only if federal financial participation is not available. Because counties are required to make Medi-Cal eligibility determinations and this bill would expand Medi-Cal eligibility, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require the department to adopt regulations by July 1, 2018, and, commencing July 1, 2016, would require the department to provide a status report to the Legislature on a semiannual basis until regulations have been adopted.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.
Existing law provides for the regulation and licensure of clinical laboratories and clinical laboratory personnel by the State Department of Public Health and makes a violation of a provision under this law a misdemeanor. Existing law authorizes a person to request, and a licensed clinical laboratory or public health laboratory to perform specified clinical laboratory tests, including pregnancy, glucose level, cholesterol, and occult blood tests. Existing law authorizes a registered clinical laboratory to perform these tests if the test is subject to a certificate of waiver under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and the laboratory has registered with the State Department of Public Health.
Existing law authorizes the results of the test to be provided directly to the person requesting the test if the test is on or for his or her own body. Existing law requires that those test results be provided in a manner that presents clear information and that identifies results indicating the need for referral to a physician.
This bill would repeal those provisions and instead allow a person to request, and a licensed clinical laboratory or public health laboratory to perform, any laboratory test that the laboratory offers to the public on a direct access basis without a healing arts licensee’s order. If a laboratory test is conducted without an order from a healing arts licensee, the bill would require any report of the test results to be provided to the person who was the subject of the test. The bill would require the report to state in bold type that it is the responsibility of the person who was tested to arrange with his or her health care provider for consultation and interpretation of the test results. The bill would make additional conforming changes. By changing the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Declares the intent of the Legislature in enacting this bill to increase opportunities for enrollment in comprehensive health care coverage for adults, regardless of immigration status. Authorizes a person 19 years or older who meets all of the eligibility requirements for full-scope Medi-Cal benefits, but for his or her immigration status, to be enrolled for such benefits when a county completes the Medi-Cal eligibility determination process and the county shall transmit this information to the Department of Health and Human Services to determine if sufficient funding is available. Requires: (1) such an individual to enroll into Medi-Cal managed care health plans to the extent required of otherwise eligible Medi-Cal recipients who are similarly situated, and (2) benefits for services under this Act to be provided with state-only funds only if federal financial participation is not available for those services."
"Existing federal law, the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990, which is administered by the State Department of Education in California, requires that a state plan include requirements that specified child care providers receive minimum health and safety training relating to, among other things, the prevention and control of infectious diseases and the handling and storage of hazardous materials in order to receiving funding for child care.
Existing law, the California Child Day Care Facilities Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of child day care facilities by the State Department of Social Services. Existing law, the Child Care and Development Services Act, administered by the State Department of Education, requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to administer child care and development programs that offer a full range of services for eligible children from infancy to 13 years of age, including, among others, resource and referral programs, alternative payment programs, and family child care home education networks.
This bill would, effective July 1, 2017, require a caregiver, as defined, to attend a one-time, two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession, and on how to identify and avoid those risks. The bill would require the State Department of Education, in consultation with the State Department of Public Health and child care caregivers, to develop the curriculum for the training, which is required to include, among other things, a discussion of specified risks, including chemical and biological hazards. The bill would also require the department to contract with an entity to provide the occupational health and safety training and to compensate a caregiver for his or her time for attending the training.
Existing law provides that each school district governing board has general control of, and responsibility for, all aspects of the interscholastic athletic policies, programs, and activities in its district, as specified. Existing law authorizes school district governing boards to enter into associations or consortia with other school district governing boards for the purpose of governing regional or statewide interscholastic athletic programs, as specified. Existing law prohibits voluntary interscholastic athletic associations from discriminating against, or denying the benefits of any program to, any person on the basis of specified personal characteristics. Existing law also prohibits voluntary interscholastic athletic associations from denying a school from participation in interscholastic athletic activities because of the religious tenets of the school.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.","This bill requires a caregiver to attend a one-time, two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession and on how to identify and avoid those risks. A caregiver shall be required to complete such training within two years of when the training is first offered pursuant to this bill, or within three months of the caregiver beginning to care for children in a licensed child day care facility, whichever occurs later. The Department of Education shall contract with an entity to provide the occupational health and safety training, based on a competitive process, to caregivers."
"Under existing law, a public utility is required to bill its customers for various taxes imposed by a public entity and remit the revenues from those taxes that are collected to the public entity. The Public Utilities Act provides that a public utility or other service supplier is not liable to any customer as a result of collecting these taxes, and grants various rights to, and imposes various requirements on, public utilities and other service suppliers with respect to the imposition, repeal, or collection of the taxes. Existing law, the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006, establishes a procedure for the issuance of state franchises for the provision of video service, defined to include cable service and open-video systems, administered by the Public Utilities Commission.
This bill would explicitly define the term “other service supplier” for the purpose of those provisions to include, but not be limited to, a holder of a state franchise for the provision of video service.","Declares that, with respect to all taxes enacted by any local jurisdiction, including any city, county, or city and county, including a chartered city or county, any district, including an agency of the state, formed pursuant to general law or special act, for the local performance of governmental or proprietary functions within limited boundaries or any public or municipal corporation, and imposed on the customers of public utilities or other service suppliers, which taxes have been collected by such utilities and suppliers and remitted to such local jurisdiction, the public utility or other service supplier shall have no duty to independently investigate or inquire with the local jurisdiction concerning the validity of the tax ordinance. Declares that in connection with any actions or claims relating to or arising from the invalidity of the tax ordinance, in whole or part, such utility or supplier shall not be liable to any customer as a consequence of collecting the tax. Declares that in the event a local jurisdiction is ordered to refund the tax, it shall be the sole responsibility of such jurisdiction to refund the tax. Provides that unless a utility or supplier is reimbursed by the local jurisdiction for the actual cost of assisting such jurisdiction, such utility or supplier shall not be required to assist the local jurisdiction to refund the tax, including, but not limited"
"The Ralph M. Brown Act requires that all meetings of a legislative body of a local agency be open and public, except that closed sessions may be held under prescribed circumstances. Existing law authorizes the legislative body to hold a closed session to consider the appointment, employment, evaluation of performance, discipline, or dismissal of a public employee, but generally prohibits the closed session from including discussion or action on proposed compensation. Existing law authorizes the legislative body to hold a closed session with the local agency’s designated representatives regarding the salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits of its represented and unrepresented employees, but prohibits the closed session from including final action on the proposed compensation of one or more unrepresented employees. Existing law prohibits the legislative body from calling a special meeting regarding the salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits of a local agency executive, as defined.
This bill, prior to taking final action, would require the legislative body to orally report a summary of a recommendation for a final action on the salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits of a local agency executive during the open meeting in which the final action is to be taken.
By imposing new requirements on cities, counties, cities and counties, and special districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the government code to allow the legislative bodies of local agencies to use teleconferencing for the benefit of the public and to protect the statutory and constitutional rights of the parties or the public appearing before their bodies. Teleconferencing may be used for all purposes in connection with any meeting within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body. All votes taken during a teleconferenced meeting shall be by rollcall. If the legislative body of a local agency elects to use teleconferencing, it shall post agendas at all teleconference locations and conduct teleconference meetings in a manner that protects the statutory and constitutional rights of the parties or the public appearing before its legislative body. During the teleconference, at least a quorum of the members of the legislative body shall participate from locations within the boundaries of the territory over which the local agency exercises jurisdiction, except that the agenda shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to address the legislative body directly at each teleconference location."
"The Personal Income Tax Law, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, allows various deductions from gross income in computing adjusted gross income under that law, including deductions for payments to individual retirement accounts, alimony payments, and interest on educational loans.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, and before January 1, 2021, would allow a deduction in computing adjusted gross income for those amounts contributed to a Coverdell education savings account, up to $750 per taxable year, as provided. The bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, and before January 1, 2021, would also allow a deduction in computing adjusted gross income, not to exceed $2,500, for the cost of education-related expenses of the taxpayer’s dependent child or children attending public or private school, as specified.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the tax treatment of educational expenses, to allow: (1) an income-based tax deduction for up to $7,500 per year of the qualified education-related expenses of a dependent child; and (2) a tax deduction for contributions to a Coverdell education savings account. The bill defines &quot;qualified education-related expenses&quot; as: kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive; rental or purchase of educational equipment required for classes during the regular school day; fees for college courses at public institutions or independent nonprofit colleges; psychoeducational diagnostic evaluations to assess the cognitive and academic abilities of dependent children who have an individualized education program or its equivalent; public transportation or third party enrichment programs; or out-of-school enrichment programs."
"(1) The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment. CEQA establishes a procedure by which a person may seek judicial review of the decision of the lead agency made pursuant to CEQA and a procedure for the preparation and certification of the record of proceedings upon the filing of an action or proceeding challenging a lead agency’s action on the grounds of noncompliance with CEQA.
The Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014 (Proposition 1), approved by the voters at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, authorizes the issuance of bonds pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law to finance a water quality, supply, and infrastructure improvement program.
This bill would require a lead agency, in certifying the environmental impact report and in granting approvals for certain water storage projects funded, in whole or in part, by Proposition 1, to comply with specified procedures. Because a public agency would be required to comply with those new procedures, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize the lead agency to concurrently prepare the record of proceedings for the project. The bill would require the Judicial Council, on or before July 1, 2017, to adopt a rule of court to establish procedures applicable to actions or proceedings seeking judicial review of a lead agency’s action in certifying the environmental impact report and in granting approval for those projects that require the actions or proceedings, including any appeals therefrom, be resolved, to the extent feasible, within 370 days of the certification of the record of proceedings. The bill would prohibit a court from staying or enjoining those projects unless it makes specified findings.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires the Judicial Council of California to adopt a rule of court to establish procedures applicable to actions or proceedings brought to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul the certification of an environmental impact report for a water storage project or the granting of any approvals for such a project, as defined by this bill. Such procedures shall apply to actions or proceedings brought to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul the certification of an environmental impact report for a water storage project or the granting of any approvals for such a project, as defined by this bill. The draft and final environmental impact report for such a project shall include a notice stating that the report is subject to such procedures if the action or proceedings brought to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul the certification of the environmental impact report for a water storage project or the granting of any project approvals require the actions or proceedings to be resolved, to the extent feasible, within 370 days of certification of the record proceedings. Within 10 days before close of the public comment period, the lead agency shall hold a hearing on the draft environmental impact report or a proposed reporting and monitoring program required by this bill. The lead agency: (1) within 5 days following the close of the public comment period, shall conduct"
"(1) Existing law prohibits the sale, gift, and loan of a large-capacity magazine. A violation of this prohibition is punishable as a misdemeanor with specified penalties or as a felony.
This bill would, commencing July 1, 2017, make it an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed $100 for the first offense, by a fine not to exceed $250 for the 2nd offense, and by a fine not to exceed $500 for the 3rd or subsequent offense, for a person to possess any large-capacity magazine, regardless of the date the magazine was acquired. The bill would require a person in lawful possession of a large-capacity magazine prior to July 1, 2017, to dispose of the magazine, as provided.
By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law creates various exceptions to the crime described in paragraph (1) above, which include, but are not limited to, the sale of, giving of, lending of, importation into this state of, or purchase of, any large-capacity magazine to or by the holder of a special weapons permit for use as a prop for a motion picture, or any federal, state, county, city and county, or city agency that is charged with the enforcement of any law, for use by agency employees in the discharge of their official duties, whether on or off duty, and where the use is authorized by the agency and is within the course and scope of their duties.
This bill would make conforming changes to those exceptions by including possession of a large-capacity magazine in those provisions and would establish additional exceptions to the crime described in paragraph (1) above, including exceptions to allow licensed gunsmiths and honorably retired sworn peace officers to possess a large-capacity magazine.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 23, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the federal criminal code to revise the prohibition against manufacturing, importing, keeping for sale, or offering or exposing for sale a large-capacity magazine. Specifically, it prohibits and sets penalties for possessing a large-capacity magazine that is manufactured after July 1, 2017, in California. Prior to such date, any person who possesses a large-capacity magazine must dispose of it: (1) by selling it to a licensed firearms dealer, (2) by surrendering it to a law enforcement agency for destruction, or (3) by lending or transferring it to a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency."
"Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, provides for the licensure and regulation of pharmacists and pharmacies by the California State Board of Pharmacy. Existing law imposes requirements on audits of pharmacy services provided to beneficiaries of a health benefit plan, as specified.
This bill would prohibit a pharmacy benefit manager, as defined, from requiring that a pharmacist or pharmacy provide reimbursement to the pharmacy benefit manager for the cost of any drug dispensed to a patient that was properly adjudicated, as defined, except upon a showing of fraud or malfeasance. The bill would require any improper reimbursement made under those provisions during a specified 5-year period to be refunded to the pharmacist or pharmacy, as specified.
The Pharmacy Law establishes in the Department of Consumer Affairs the California State Board of Pharmacy, which consists of 13 members.
This bill would make a nonsubstantive change to these provisions.","This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to prohibit a pharmacy benefit manager from requiring that a pharmacist or pharmacy provide reimbursement for the cost of any drug dispensed to a patient that was previously authorized and properly adjudicated, except upon a showing of fraud or malfeasance. A contract entered into between a pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacist or pharmacy shall include a provision that conflicts with such prohibition. A pharmacy benefit manager that administers pharmacy benefits management in California that has requested and received any improper reimbursements from a pharmacist or pharmacy must refund that payment to the pharmacist or pharmacy. This prohibition shall not apply to reimbursements received between January 1, 2012, and January 1, 2017. The bill establishes a California State Board of Pharmacy in the Department of Consumer Affairs."
"Existing property tax law provides, pursuant to the authorization of the California Constitution, a disabled veteran’s property tax exemption for the principal place of residence of a veteran or a veteran’s spouse, including an unmarried surviving spouse, if the veteran, because of an injury incurred in military service, is blind in both eyes, has lost the use of 2 or more limbs, or is totally disabled, as those terms are defined, or if the veteran has, as a result of a service-connected injury or disease, died while on active duty in military service. That law defines a veteran for its purposes as a person who, among other things, is serving in or has served in and has been discharged under honorable conditions from service in the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard.
This bill, for property tax lien dates for the 2017–18 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, would expand that definition of veteran to include a person who has been discharged in other than dishonorable conditions from service under those same conditions and who has been determined by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to be eligible for federal veterans’ health and medical benefits.
Existing property tax law allows the correction of certain errors resulting in incorrect entries on the property tax roll within 4 years after the making of the assessment.
This bill would extend the time for correcting errors to the roll related to the disabled veterans’ exemption to 8 years.
Existing law requires property taxes to be refunded upon the filing of a claim within 8 years after making the payment sought to be refunded if the claim relates to the disabled veterans’ exemption.
This bill would instead require a refund on a claim filed within 8 years after making the payment sought to be refunded, or within 60 days of the date of a specified notice, whichever is later.
Existing property tax law authorizes any taxes paid before or after delinquency to be refunded by the county tax collector within 4 years after the date of payment under specified conditions.
This bill would authorize any taxes paid before or after delinquency to be refunded by the county tax collector within 8 years after the date of payment if the amount paid exceeds the amount due on the property as a result of corrections to the roll that relate to the disabled veterans’ exemption.
By changing the manner in which local county officials administer property tax refunds with respect to the disabled veterans’ exemption, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.
This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2009. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program.
Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and imposes certain requirements on health care service plans. Existing law imposes various fines and administrative penalties on health care service plans for certain violations of the act, which are deposited into the Managed Care Administrative Fines and Penalties Fund. Existing law requires the first $1,000,000 in the fund to be transferred each year to the Medically Underserved Account for Physicians and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes of the Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program. Existing law requires all remaining funds to be transferred each year to the Major Risk Medical Insurance Fund and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for purposes of the Major Risk Medical Insurance Program.
This bill would expand the eligibility for loan repayment funds under the Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program to include those physicians providing psychiatric services. The bill would provide that continuously appropriated funds deposited into the Medically Underserved Account for Physicians shall not be made available under the Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program to fund the repayment of loans for those physicians providing psychiatric services or those physicians whose primary specialty is psychiatry, as specified.
The bill would instead require, after the first $1,000,000 is transferred from the Managed Care Administrative Fines and Penalties Fund to the Medically Underserved Account for Physicians, $1,000,000 to be transferred each year to the Major Risk Medical Insurance Fund to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the Major Risk Medical Insurance Program. The bill would require any amount remaining over the amounts transferred to the Medically Underserved Account for Physicians and the Major Risk Medical Insurance Fund to be transferred each year to the Medically Underserved Account for Physicians to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the Steven M.

Existing law also requires the notice to include a card that is to be returned to the assessor by an applicant desiring to maintain eligibility for the welfare exemption.
This bill would instead require the State Board of Equalization to prescribe the form and content of the notice after consultation with the California Assessors’ Association.

The California Constitution generally exempts real property that is owned by a local government from property taxation, but provides that real property owned by a local government that is located outside its boundaries is taxable if it was taxable when acquired. Existing law authorizes a county, city and county, or municipal corporation that owns taxable property to apply to the State Board of Equalization for a review, equalization, or adjustment of a property tax assessment relating to this publicly owned property. Existing law requires that this application be submitted to the board on or before the later of either July 20 or within 2 weeks of the date upon which a county assessor delivers the local roll containing that assessment to the county auditor.

The Political Reform Act of 1974 requires persons holding specified public offices to file disclosures of investments, real property interests, and income within specified periods of assuming or leaving office, and annually while holding the office. The act requires the disclosures to include a statement indicating, within a specified value range, the fair market value of investments or interests in real property and the aggregate value of income received from a source.
This bill would increase the thresholds at which a public official has a disqualifying financial interest in sources of income from $500 to $1,000, in investments in business entities from $2,000 to $5,000, and in interests in real property from $2,000 to $10,000.

This bill would, until January 1, 2019, require each state agency to, on or before January 1, 2018, review that agency’s regulations, identify any regulations that are duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out of date, to revise those identified regulations, as provided, and report to the Legislature and Governor, as specified.","This bill requires state agencies to: (1) review all provisions of the California Code of Regulations applicable to, or adopted by, those agencies; (2) identify any regulations that are duplicative, overlapping, inconsistencies, or out-of-date; (3) adopt, amend, or repeal regulations to reconcile or eliminate any duplication, overlap, inconsistencies, or out-of-date provisions; and (4) hold at least one noticed public hearing on a proposed revision to regulations. The bill requires agencies to notify their departments, boards, or other units of any existing regulations adopted by that agency that may be duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent with a regulation adopted by another agency, or inconsistent with a regulation adopted by the state agency."
"(1) Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public higher education in the state. Existing law generally requires community college districts to charge a tuition fee to nonresident students, but exempts specified community college students from paying that nonresident tuition fee.
This bill would additionally exempt nonresident students living in California and enrolled at a community
college
college, as specified,
who are covered individuals, as defined in a specified federal statute, using, or are intending to use, Federal GI Bill education benefits, as specified, to cover the costs associated with enrollment as a community college student.
This bill would authorize community college districts to report students exempted from nonresident tuition under this bill as resident full-time equivalent students for purposes of calculating apportionments to those districts.
To the extent that this bill would place additional requirements on community college districts regarding the provision of postsecondary education benefits to certain students, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
(3) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on December 21, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Authorizes a community college district in California to admit and charge a tuition fee to nonresident students, except that the district may exempt from the fee any person who: (1) enrolls for six or fewer units; (2) is both a U.S. citizen and resident of a foreign country; (3) has a parent or guardian who has been deported or was permitted to depart voluntarily under the federal Immigration and Nationality Act; (4) lives in California immediately before moving abroad; (5) attended a public or private secondary school in California for three or more years; and (6) upon enrollment, will be in his or her first academic year as a matriculated student at the community college and will file an affidavit stating that he or she intends to establish residency in California as soon as possible. Exempts from such fee: (1) students who as of August 29, 2005, were enrolled, admitted with an intention to continue, or who could not be reported to be so enrolled, except as a result of Hurricane Katrina; and (2) special part-time students who are both a U.S. citizen and resident of a foreign country and who have demonstrated a financial need for the exemption."
"Existing law requires a civil action brought by a victim of human trafficking, as defined, to be commenced within 5 years of the date on which the trafficking victim was freed from the trafficking situation or, if the victim was a minor when the act of human trafficking against the victim occurred, within 8 years after the date the plaintiff attains the age of majority.
This bill would require a civil action for human trafficking, as defined, to be commenced within 7 years of the date on which the trafficking victim was freed from the trafficking situation or, if the victim was a minor when the act of human trafficking against the victim occurred, within 10 years after the date the plaintiff attains the age of majority.
Existing law requires a civil action for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the death of, an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another to be commenced with 2 years.
This bill would require (1) a civil action for assault, battery, or wrongful death, when the conduct would also constitute torture, genocide, a war crime, an attempted extrajudicial killing, or a crime against humanity, as defined, (2) a civil action for the taking of property in violation of international law, as defined, or (3) a civil action seeking benefits under an insurance policy, where the insurance claim arises out of any of the conduct specified above, to be commenced within 10 years. The bill would authorize a prevailing plaintiff to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and litigation costs. The bill would provide that the provisions are severable, as specified.","Amends the Civil Code to allow a victim of human trafficking to bring a civil action for actual damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, any combination of those, or any other appropriate relief, and to be awarded attorney's fees and costs. Allows such plaintiff to be awarded up to three times his or her actual damages or ten thousand dollars whichever is greater. Requires an action to be commenced within seven years of the date on which the trafficking victim was freed from the trafficking situation or, if the victim was a minor when the act of human trafficking against the victim occurred, within ten years after the date the plaintiff attains the age of majority. Provides that if a person entitled to sue is under a disability at the time the cause of action accrues so that it is impossible or impracticable for him or her to bring an action, the time of the disability is not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action. States that: (1) the statute of limitations shall not run against a plaintiff who is a minor or who lacks the legal competence to make decisions simply because a guardian ad litem has been appointed; (2) an action under this section shall not prejudice the plaintiff's right to do so after his or her disability ceases;"
"Existing law, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, an initiative measure enacted by the approval of Proposition 215 at the November 5, 1996, statewide general election, authorizes the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Existing law, enacted by the Legislature, provides for the licensing and regulation by both state and local entities of medical marijuana and its cultivation. Existing law provides that if a city, county, or city and county does not have land use regulations or ordinances regulating or prohibiting the cultivation of marijuana, commencing March 1, 2016, the Department of Food and Agriculture is the sole licensing authority for medical marijuana cultivation applicants in that city, county, or city and county.
This bill would delete the provision that grants the department the sole licensing authority under those circumstances.
Existing law exempts certain persons cultivating medical marijuana from the requirement to obtain both a state license from the Department of Food and Agriculture and a license, permit, or other entitlement allowing cultivation from the city, county, or city and county in which the cultivation will occur. Existing law authorizes a city, county, or city and county to regulate or ban the cultivation, storage, manufacture, transport, provision, or other activity by a person otherwise exempt from state regulation, or to enforce that regulation or ban.
This bill would instead provide that an exemption from these licensure requirements does not limit or prevent a city, county, or city and county from exercising its police power authority under a specified provision of the California Constitution.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","This bill requires the Department of Food and Agriculture to establish a Medical Cannabis Cultivation Program for the cultivation of medical marijuana, which shall include a unique identifier for each plant."
"The Passenger Charter-party Carriers’ Act, with certain exceptions, prohibits a charter-party carrier of passengers from engaging in transportation services subject to regulation by the Public Utilities Commission without obtaining a specified certificate or permit, as appropriate, from the commission, and imposes various other requirements. Existing law requires, as a condition to obtaining a certificate or permit, that the applicant, among other things, participate in a program to regularly check the driving records of all vehicle operators and provide a mandatory controlled substance and alcohol testing certification program. A violation of the act is generally a misdemeanor. Existing law defines a transportation network company as an organization, whether a corporation, partnership, sole proprietor, or other form, operating in California that provides prearranged transportation services for compensation using an online-enabled platform to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles.
This bill would prohibit the commission from issuing or renewing a permit or certificate to a charter-party carrier of passengers unless the applicant, in addition to existing requirements, participates in the Department of Motor
Vehicles
Vehicles
’
pull-notice system. This bill would specifically require a transportation network company to comply with this provision and to provide for a mandatory controlled substance and alcohol testing certification program. The bill would also require a transportation network company to register any vehicle used in the transportation of passengers for compensation with the commission and display an identifying
decal issued
symbol prescribed
by the commission on the vehicle.
The bill would require that drivers hired or initially retained by a transportation network company on or after January 1, 2016, be subject to mandatory drug and alcohol testing prior to employment or retention and that drivers hired or initially retained before January 1, 2016, complete a drug and alcohol test before January 1, 2017.
Because a violation of these provisions would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2015. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Public Utilities Code to require a charter-party carrier applying for a permit or certificate to provide transportation of passengers to establish reasonable fitness and financial responsibility to initiate and conduct the proposed or existing transportation services. The California Public Utilities Commission shall not issue or renew a permit or certificate to a charter-party carrier unless the applicant meets specified requirements, including that it: is financially and organizationally capable of conducting an operation that complies with state and federal motor vehicle safety regulations, is committed to observing the hours of service regulations of the California Highway Patrol, has a preventive maintenance program in effect for its vehicles used for compensation, participates in the pull-notice system to regularly check the driving records of all persons, has a safety education and training program for all employees or subcarriers operating vehicles used for compensation, and will maintain its vehicles in a safe operating condition and in compliance with the Vehicle Code and related regulations. The bill exempts from such requirements a charter-party carrier that provides hired driver service when a rented motor vehicle is being operated by the hired driver. The commission may require, as a precondition to permit or certificate issuance, the procurement of a performance bond"
"The Cal Grant Program establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions.
Existing law requires the commission to certify by November 1 of each year a qualifying institution’s latest 3-year cohort default rate and graduation rate as most recently reported by the United States Department of Education. Existing law provides that an otherwise qualifying institution with a 3-year cohort default rate that is equal to or greater than 15.5% is ineligible for initial and renewal Cal Grant awards at the institution. Existing law provides that an otherwise qualifying institution is ineligible for an initial or renewal Cal Grant award at the institution if the institution has a graduation rate of 30% or less for students taking 150% or less of the expected time to complete degree requirements, as specified, with certain exceptions.
This bill would require the commission to establish an appeal process for an otherwise qualifying institution that fails to satisfy the 3-year cohort default rate and graduation rate requirements and would authorize the commission to grant the appeal for an academic year only if the commission makes a specified determination.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on February 29, 2015. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Education Code to revise the California Student Aid Program. Under current law, the California Student Aid Commission must determine an academic year for a qualifying institution (i.e., a community college or an institution of higher education [IHE] that award an associate or baccalaureate degree requiring at least 48 semester units or the equivalent) based upon access costs and specified terms and regulations. The bill eliminates this requirement and replaces it with a requirement that the commission annually adjust the maximum household income and asset level for participating students based on the percentage change in the cost of living within the meaning of the California Constitution. It also sets the maximum independent household income and asset ceiling for students under the program at $23,600, subject to specified adjustments. No applicant or recipient with dependents other than a spouse shall be considered under the simplified needs test established by federal law. The commission shall annually adjust the maximum household income and asset levels based on the percentage change in the cost of living within the meaning of the California Constitution."

The bill would require an applicant with 20 or more employees to attest on the application that the applicant will implement an employee training program approved by the licensing authority within one year of licensure, as specified, thereby modifying the crime of perjury and imposing a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the licensing authority to deny an application of an applicant with 20 or more employees unless the applicant makes the above-mentioned attestation on the application. The bill would require each licensing authority to adopt standards for the approval of employee training programs. The bill would prohibit the licensing authority from approving a program provided by or through certain apprenticeship

The bill would authorize the licensing authority to approve a workplace training organization, as defined, as a 3rd-party provider. The bill would require each licensing authority to charge a fee for approving an employee training program, as specified. The bill would require that the fees collected be deposited in the appropriate account within the Medical

Existing law makes a violation of these provisions punishable by specified fines or terms of imprisonment, or by both those fines and imprisonment.
This bill would clarify the criminal penalties for specified computer crimes by making a person who violates those provisions guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for 16 months, or 2 or 3 years and a fine not exceeding $10,000, or a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, by a fine not exceeding $5,000, or by both that fine and imprisonment.","Amends the California criminal code to prohibit unauthorized access to: (1) any computer system, network, or computer program; (2) any computer service, including computer time, data processing, or storage functions, Internet services, electronic mail services, electronic message services, or other uses of a computer, computer system, or computer network; and (3) government computer systems, including computer systems owned, operated, or used by governmental entities that are necessary for the health and safety of the public. <n>Includes within the definition of ""victim expenditure"" any expenditure reasonably and necessarily incurred by the owner or lessee to verify that a computer system, computer network, computer program, or data was or was not altered, deleted, damaged, or destroyed by the access. <n>Defines: (1) ""access"" as gaining entry to, instruct, cause input to, cause output from, cause data processing with, or communicate with the logical, arithmetical, or memory function resources of a computer, computer system, or computer network; (2) ""computer network"" as any system that provides communications between one or more computer systems and input/output devices, including display terminals, remote systems, mobile devices, and printers connected by telecommunication facilities; (3) ""computer program or software"" as a set of instructions or"
"Existing law, the Federal Surplus Property Acquisition Law of 1945, authorizes a local agency, as defined, to acquire surplus federal property without regard to any law which requires posting of notices or advertising for bids, inviting or receiving bids, delivery of purchases before payment, or prevents the local agency from bidding on federal surplus property. Existing federal law authorizes the Department of Defense to transfer surplus personal property, including arms and ammunition, to federal or state agencies for use in law enforcement activities, subject to specified conditions, at no cost to the acquiring agency.
This bill would prohibit a local agency, other than a local law enforcement agency that is directly under the control of an elected officer, from applying to receive tactical surplus military equipment, as defined, pursuant to the above-described federal law unless the legislative body of the local agency approves the acquisition by ordinance or resolution at a regular public meeting. The bill would require the ordinance or resolution to include a list of the types of tactical surplus military equipment and would require the legislative body to review the ordinance at least annually, as specified. The bill would prohibit a local agency from applying to receive specified types of equipment. The bill would also declare that this is a matter of statewide concern.

By adding to the duties of local government officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.

Existing federal law, the Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, provides for the integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems, commonly known as drones, into the national airspace system by September 30, 2015. Existing federal law requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to develop and implement operational and certification requirements for the operation of public unmanned aircraft systems in the national airspace system by December 31, 2015.
This bill would generally prohibit public agencies from using unmanned aircraft systems, or contracting for the use of unmanned aircraft systems, as defined, with certain exceptions applicable to law enforcement agencies and in certain other cases, including when the use or operation of the unmanned aircraft system achieves the core mission of the agency and the purpose is unrelated to the gathering of criminal intelligence, as defined.

"(1) Existing law requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations relating to the use of voting systems in recounting ballots.
This bill would also require the Secretary of State to revise and adopt regulations relating to procedures for recounting ballots, including regulations establishing guidelines for the charges a county elections official may impose when conducting a manual recount.
(2) Existing law establishes procedures by which a voter may request a recount of the votes cast in an election following completion of the official canvass. Existing law requires a voter to make this request within 5 days beginning on the 29th day after the election.
This bill would instead permit a voter to file a request for a recount within 5 days beginning on the 30th day after the election.
(3) Any time during the conduct of a recount and for 24 hours thereafter, existing law permits any other voter to request a recount of any precincts in an election for the same office, slate of presidential electors, or measure not recounted as a result of the original request. Existing law also provides that, where applicable, a voter requesting a recount may select whether the recount shall be conducted manually, or by means of the voting system used originally, or both.
This bill would instead require a voter to select, for each type of voting system used, whether the recount is to be conducted manually, or by means of the voting system used originally, but not both. This bill would also specify that if more than one voter requests a recount of the same office or measure, and at least one request is for a manual recount, then the county elections official of any county subject to multiple requests is only obligated to conduct one manual recount of the ballots subject to the request, and that those results will control.
(4) Under existing law, a voter seeking a recount is required, before the recount is commenced and at the beginning of each subsequent day, to deposit with the elections official the amount of money required by the elections official to cover the cost of the recount for that day.
This bill would permit the Governor or Secretary of State, as specified, to order a state-funded manual recount of all votes cast for a statewide office or a state ballot measure if the difference in the number of votes received is less than or equal to the lesser of 1,000 votes or 0.00015 of the number of all votes cast, as specified. This bill would also require a county elections official to review rejected ballots as part of a state-funded recount.
(5) Under existing law, upon completion of a recount showing that a different candidate was nominated or elected, that a different presidential slate of electors received a plurality of the votes, or that a measure was defeated instead of approved or approved instead of defeated, the result of the recount in each affected precinct is entered and is thereafter considered the official return of the affected precincts. Existing law provides that if an office, slates of presidential electors, or measure is voted on statewide, the results of any recount are null and void unless each vote cast for the office, slates, or measure in any county specified in the request for recount is recounted.
This bill would instead provide that if an office, slates of presidential electors, or measure is voted on statewide, the results of any recount are null and void unless each vote cast statewide for the office, slates, or measure is recounted.
(6) Existing law requires the Secretary of State to certify or conditionally approve a voting system prior to any election at which it is to be used, as specified. Existing law prohibits the Secretary of State from certifying or conditionally approving a voting system or part of a voting system that does not have certain technical capabilities.
This bill would also prohibit the Secretary of State from certifying or conditionally approving a voting system that cannot facilitate the conduct of a ballot level comparison risk-limiting audit; however, it would expressly permit the Secretary of State to approve a proposed change or modification to a noncompliant voting system even if the voting system would be unable to facilitate the conduct of a ballot level comparison risk-limiting audit after the change or modification.

This bill would make various legislative findings and declarations relating to the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock, and would declare the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would address the overuse of antibiotics in livestock production.","This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require an applicant for approval of a new animal drug that is a nontherapeutic use of certain antibiotics in food-producing animals to demonstrate that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm to human health from antimicrobial resistance attributable to the nontherapeutic use of the drug. An antimicrobial is a drug intended for use in food-producing animals that contains: (1) specified antibiotics, or (2) certain drugs on the World Health Organization&rsquo;s list of critically important antimicrobials. Two years after enactment of this Act, the Food and Drug Administration must withdraw approval of a nontherapeutic use of such drugs in food-producing animals unless certain safety requirements are met."
"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including perinatal services for pregnant women.
Existing law establishes the Nurse-Family Partnership program, which is administered by the State Department of Public Health, to provide grants for voluntary nurse home visiting programs for expectant first-time mothers, their children, and their families. Under existing law, a county is required to satisfy specified requirements in order to be eligible to receive a grant.
This bill would require the State Department of Health Care Services, in consultation with specified stakeholders, to develop a feasibility plan on or before January 1, 2017, that describes the costs, benefits, and any potential barriers related to offering evidence-based home visiting programs to Medi-Cal eligible pregnant and parenting women. The bill would also require the department, in developing the plan, to consider, among other things, establishing Medi-Cal coverage for evidence-based home visiting program services and incentives for Medi-Cal providers to offer those services, and would require the department, in developing the plan, to prioritize the identification of funding sources, other than General Fund moneys, to fund evidence-based home visiting program services.",". The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services&nbsp;to give priority to evidence-based maternal home visiting programs in awarding grants or contracts. Specifically, evidence-based maternal home visiting programs are those that meet specified requirements, including that they address the needs of pregnant and parenting mothers and their families during the pivotal time from pregnancy to five years old."
"Existing law, the Assisted Outpatient Treatment Demonstration Project Act of 2002, known as Laura’s Law, until January 1, 2017, grants each county the authority to offer certain assisted outpatient treatment services for their residents by adoption of a resolution or through the county budget process and by making a finding that no mental health program, as specified, may be reduced as a result of implementation. Under that law, participating counties are required to provide prescribed assisted outpatient services, including a service planning and delivery process, that are client-directed and employ psychosocial rehabilitation and recovery principles. Existing law authorizes participating counties to pay for the services provided from moneys distributed to the counties from various continuously appropriated funds, including the Local Revenue Fund and the Mental Health Services Fund when included in a county plan, as specified. Existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services to submit a report and evaluation of all counties implementing any component of these provisions to the Governor and the Legislature by July 1, 2015.
This bill would extend the operation of the program until January 1, 2022, and would delete that reporting requirement. By extending the authorization to pay for the services using moneys from various continuously appropriated funds, the bill would make an appropriation.
Existing law requires a county that operates an assisted outpatient treatment program pursuant to these provisions to provide data to the department, and requires the department to report to the Legislature on or before May 1 of each year based on that data, as specified.
This bill would additionally require the department to report that information to the Governor.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to require, for purposes of assisted outpatient treatment services, a county that chooses to provide such services to offer: (1) community-based, mobile, multidisciplinary, highly trained mental health teams that use high staff-to-client ratios of no more than 10 clients per team member for those subject to court-ordered services; (2) a service planning and delivery process that includes the determination of the numbers of persons to be served and the programs and services that will be provided to meet their needs; (3) each client to have a clearly designated mental health personal services coordinator who may be part of a multidisciplinary treatment team responsible for providing or assuring needed services; and (4) a plan containing all appropriate community services, monitoring of the quality and follow-through of services, and necessary advocacy to ensure each client receives those services that are agreed to in the client's personal services plan."
"Existing law, the State Bar Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of attorneys by the State Bar of California, a public corporation. Existing law prohibits an attorney from demanding or accepting the advance payment of any funds from a person before the enactment of an immigration reform act, as defined, that is enacted after October 5, 2013, and before January 1, 2017, and requires any funds received during a specified time to be refunded to the client promptly, but no later than 30 days after the receipt of any funds, as provided. Existing law requires the State Bar to provide specified information relating to immigration reform act services on its Internet Web site.
This bill would revise the definition of an immigration reform act to include any immigration reform act enacted after October 5, 2013, the President’s executive actions on immigration announced on November 20, 2014, or any future executive action or order that authorizes an undocumented immigrant who entered the United States without inspection, who did not depart after the expiration of a nonimmigrant visa, or who stayed beyond an approved period, to attain a lawful status under federal law or to otherwise remain in the country. This bill would require the State Bar to announce and post on its Internet Web site when an executive action or order described above has been issued. This bill would provide that it is unlawful for an attorney to demand or accept the advance payment of any funds for immigration reform act services in connection with requests for expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, requests for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or other future relief, as provided, under federal law. This bill would also provide that an advance payment of funds for immigration reform act services may be placed into a client trust account, as specified.
Existing law provides for the regulation of a person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of an immigration consultant, and provides that a violation of these provisions is a crime. Existing law requires an immigration consultant to establish a client trust account and to deposit in this account any funds received from the client prior to performing immigration reform act services, as defined, for that client. Existing law prohibits an immigration consultant from demanding or accepting the advance payment of any funds from a person before the enactment of an immigration reform act, as defined, that is enacted after October 5, 2013, and before January 1, 2017, and requires any funds received during a specified time to be refunded to the client promptly, but no later than 30 days after the receipt of any funds, as provided. Existing law prescribes civil penalties, not to exceed $1,000 per day for each violation, for immigration consultants who violate these provisions.
This bill would revise the definition of an immigration reform act to include any immigration reform act enacted after October 5, 2013, the President’s executive actions on immigration announced on November 20, 2014, or any future executive action or order that authorizes an undocumented immigrant who either entered the United States without inspection or who did not depart after the expiration of a nonimmigrant visa, to attain a lawful status under federal law. This bill would require the State Bar to announce and post on its Internet Web site when an executive action or order described above has been issued.

Because a violation of these provisions by an immigration consultant would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2015. (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to prohibit an attorney from demanding or accepting advance payment of any funds from a person for immigration reform act services in connection with: an immigration reform act enacted before the enactment of that act when the relevant form or application is released or announced and is not subject to any pending legal action, or when the acceptance date of the relevant form or application has been announced, whichever is sooner; requests for expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) under an immigration reform act before the date the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services begins accepting those requests; requests for deferred action for parents of Americans and lawful permanent residents (DAPA) under an immigration reform act before the date Citizenship and Immigration Services begins accepting those requests; or any relief offered under any executive action announced or executive order issued before the effective date of this bill, but before the effective date of this bill, for which immigration reform act services were received after October 5, 2013, but before enactment or implementation of this bill. If an attorney providing immigration reform act services accepted funds for such services before this bill's enactment: (1) the attorney shall promptly, but no later than 30 days"
"Existing law generally requires local agencies to provide each newly hired police officer and deputy sheriff with a pistol and other specified equipment.
This bill would appropriate an unspecified sum from the General Fund to the Department of Justice for purposes of matching federal funds available to purchase body-worn cameras and related equipment for use by local peace officers. The bill would require the department to develop a matching grant program for local jurisdictions that would either allow the state to apply for federal matching funds on behalf of a local law enforcement entity, or to reimburse a local law enforcement entity that has expended its funds for purposes of obtaining federal matching funds for body-worn cameras, as described.
This bill would require the Board of State and Community Corrections to develop a grant program to make funds available to local law enforcement entities to purchase body-worn cameras and related data storage and equipment, and to hire personnel necessary to operate a local body-worn camera program. The bill would create the Body-worn Camera Fund, that would continuously appropriate funds to the board for those purposes.
Existing law creates the State Penalty Fund into which moneys collected by the courts from the imposition of fines, forfeitures, or penalties on criminal offenses are deposited. Once a month, certain percentages of money in that fund are transferred into other funds, including, among others, the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund.
This bill would delete the transfer requirement for the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund and instead require a transfer to the Body-worn Camera Fund.
By transferring general fund moneys into a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation.","Amends the Penal Code to increase California penalties for all criminal offenses, except parking offenses, where multiple offenses are involved and where a court appearance is not mandatory. Provides that the State penalty shall be based upon the total fine or bail for each case and that when a fine is suspended, the State penalty shall be reduced in proportion to the suspension. Specifies that when any deposited bail is made for an offense to which this Act applies, and for which a court appearance is not mandatory, the person making the deposit shall also deposit a sufficient amount to include the State penalty for forfeited bail. Authorizes the judge to waive all or any part of the State penalty in any case where a person convicted of any offense is in prison until the fine is satisfied. Specifies that after a determination by the court of the amount due, the clerk of the court shall collect the penalty and transmit it to the county treasury. Directs that the portion thereof attributable to Chapter 12 (commencing with Section 76000) of Title 8 of the Government Code be deposited in the State Penalty Fund and 70 percent of the balance be transmitted to the State Treasury. Specifies that the moneys so deposited shall be distributed as follows: once a month there shall be transferred into the Fish and Game Preservation Fund"
"Existing law makes it a crime to intentionally record a confidential communication without the consent of all parties to the communication. Existing law exempts specified peace officers from that provision if they are acting within the scope of their authority.
This bill would require law enforcement agencies to consider specified best practices when establishing policies and procedures for downloading and storing data from body-worn cameras, including, among other things, prohibiting the unauthorized use, duplication, or distribution of the data, and establishing storage periods for evidentiary and nonevidentiary data, as defined.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill requires the state of California to establish policies and procedures to address issues related to the downloading and storage data recorded by a body-worn camera worn by a peace officer. Specifically, law enforcement agencies, departments, or entities shall consider: designating the person responsible for downloading the recorded data if the storage system does not have automatic downloading capability; establishing when data should be downloaded to ensure the data is entered into the system in a timely manner, is properly maintained and ready for the next use, and is categorized according to the type of event or incident captured; establishing specific measures to prevent data tampering, deleting, and copying; Categorizing and tagging body-worn camera video at the time the data is downloaded and classified according to the type of event or incident captured; and state the length of time that recorded data is to be stored. Unless specified requirements are met, nonevidentiary data including video and audio recorded by a body-worn camera should be retained for a minimum of 60 days after which it may be erased, destroyed, or recycled.

"The California Constitution prohibits a person from being deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or from being denied equal protection of the laws. The United States Constitution prohibits a state from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Existing law establishes various advisory boards and commissions in state government with specified duties and responsibilities.
The federal My Brother’s Keeper Initiative, launched by the President of the United States in February 2014, required the establishment of the My Brother’s Keeper Task Force, an interagency effort to improve the expected educational and life outcomes for and address the persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color in the United States.
This bill would establish until January 1, 2026, the Interagency Task Force on the Status of Boys and Men of Color, a multiagency advisory body that would serve as a support mechanism for department agency and systems leaders by taking coordinated action in meeting the myriad of challenges facing boys and men of color in California, and assisting the respective departments and agencies in more successfully improving life outcomes for this population. The membership of the task force would include members of the Legislature, as well as representatives of specified agencies, departments, and private entities. The bill would set forth the initial and ongoing responsibilities of the task force, including, among others, an assessment of state program alignment with the objectives of the My Brother’s Keeper program, review the action plan of a specified final report of the Assembly Select Committee on the Status of Boys and Men of Color in California, and an assessment of the development of strategies to enhance positive outcomes and eliminate or mitigate negative outcomes for boys and men of color in the state. The bill would establish the Boys and Men of Color Task Force Fund, which would be subject to appropriation by the Legislature, to carry out the bill’s requirements in support of the task force, upon appropriation by the Legislature. The bill would authorize the task force to accept federal funds, gifts, donations, grants, or bequests for all or any of its purposes.",". (Sec. 1) This bill requires the Interagency Task Force on the Status of Boys and Men of Color to be focused on: getting a healthy start and entering school ready to learn, reading at grade level by third grade, graduating from high school ready for college and career education or training, successfully entering the workforce, and keeping kids giving them second chances.

The bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to include specified notices on an application for an original driver’s license and would require the department, at least monthly, to forward the necessary personal information required for registration to the federal Selective Service System in an electronic format.
This bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to implement the provisions of this bill by a certain date only if federal funding in an amount sufficient to pay for implementation and first-year operating costs has been provided and the federal Selective Service System executes a memorandum of understanding with the department, as specified.","This bill requires the Department of Transportation to require an original driver's license application to include the following statements: a man between 18 and 26 years of age consents to registration with the Selective Service System (SSS); a notice indicating that registration will result in ineligibility for federal and state student loans and grants, federal job training benefits, federal employment, state and local law enforcement employment, and U.S. citizenship for male immigrants; and a declaration that a person seeking citizenship is satisfied that alternative service information is available from the SSS on the Internet."
"Existing law establishes the Department of Housing and Community Development in the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency. The department is responsible for administering various housing and home loan programs throughout the state. Existing law also establishes the California Housing Finance Agency within the department, and provides that the primary purpose of the agency is to meet the housing needs of persons and families of low to moderate income.
Existing federal law requires the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to establish a Housing Trust Fund to provide grants to states to increase the supply of rental housing for extremely low- and very low income families, including homeless families, and home ownership for extremely low- and very low income families.
This bill would designate the Department of Housing and Community Development as the state agency responsible for administering funds received by the state from the federal Housing Trust Fund. This bill would require the department to administer the funds through existing or newly created programs that produce, preserve, rehabilitate, or support the operation of rental housing for extremely low income and very low income households, except that up to 10% of funding may be used to support home ownership for extremely low income and very low income households. The bill would require any rental project funded from the federal Housing Trust Fund to restrict affordability for 55 years, as specified, and require any home ownership program funded from the federal Housing Trust Fund to restrict affordability for 30 years, as specified.
This bill would require the department to collaborate with the California Housing Finance Agency to develop an allocation plan to demonstrate how the funds will be distributed, based on the priority housing needs identified in the state’s consolidated plan, and to convene a stakeholder process to inform the development of the plan. The bill would require the allocation plan and guidelines to give priority to projects based on specified factors. The bill would require the department to submit the plan to the Assembly Committee on Housing and Community Development and the Senate Transportation and Housing Committee 30 days after receipt of the federal funds.
The bill would authorize the department to adopt, amend, or repeal guidelines to implement these provisions. The bill would exempt these guidelines from the Administrative Procedure Act.
Existing law requires, on or before December 31 of each year, the department to submit an annual report, containing specified information, to the Governor and both houses of the Legislature on the operations and accomplishments during the previous fiscal year of the housing programs administered by the department.
This bill would require that annual report to also include an evaluation of any program established by the department to meet the legal requirements of the Federal Housing Trust Fund program guidelines.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 50408 of the Healthy and Safety Code proposed by AB 388 that would become operative if this bill and AB 388 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code to revise requirements for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to report to the governor and the Legislature annually on the operations and accomplishments of its housing programs, including, but not limited to, the Emergency Housing and Assistance Program and Community Development Block Grant activity.

"(1) Existing law requires any new diversion of water from any stream having populations of salmon and steelhead that is determined by the Department of Fish and Wildlife to be deleterious to salmon and steelhead to be screened by the owner of the diversion. Existing law requires the department to submit to the owner its proposals as to measures necessary to protect the salmon and steelhead within 30 days of receipt of a notice of a diversion of water from a stream having populations of salmon and steelhead.
This bill would instead require the department, within 30 days of providing written notice to the owner that the department has determined that the diversion is deleterious to salmon and steelhead, to submit to the owner its proposals as to measures necessary to protect the salmon and steelhead.
(2) Existing law prohibits the construction or maintenance, in certain fish and game districts, of any device or contrivance that prevents, impedes, or tends to prevent or impede, the passing of fish up and down stream. A violation of this provision is a misdemeanor.
This bill would impose an additional civil penalty of not more than $8,000 for a violation of this provision.
(3) Existing law declares that the diversion or use of water other than as authorized by specified provisions of law is a trespass. Existing law authorizes the executive director of the State Water Resources Control Board to issue a complaint to a person who violates certain laws regarding the use and diversion of water, and subjects the violator to administrative civil liability. Existing law requires that the complaint be served by personal notice or certified mail and inform the party served that the party may request a hearing not later than 20 days from the date the party was served.
This bill would authorize the Director of the Department of Fish and Wildlife, or his or her designee, to issue a complaint in accordance with the above-specified provisions alleging that an unauthorized diversion or use of water harms fish and wildlife resources.
(4) Existing law prohibits a charter city from receiving or using state funding or financial assistance for a construction project if the city has a charter provision or ordinance that authorizes a contractor to not comply with prevailing wage provisions on any public works contract or if the city has awarded, within the prior 2 years, a public works contract without requiring the contractor to comply with prevailing wage provisions, as specified. Existing law authorizes charter cities to receive or use state funding or financial assistance if the city has a local prevailing wage ordinance, applicable to all of its public works contracts, that includes requirements that are equal to or greater than the state’s prevailing wage requirements, as specified.
This bill would exempt from that prohibition funding and financial assistance provided to a charter city in response to an emergency.
(5) Existing law provides various technical assistance opportunities to disadvantaged communities for projects relating to groundwater sustainability, clean drinking water, and water recycling and advanced treatment water technology projects.
This bill would establish the Office of Sustainable Water Solutions within the State Water Resources Control Board to promote permanent and sustainable drinking water and wastewater treatment solutions to ensure effective and efficient provision of safe, clean, affordable, and reliable drinking water and wastewater treatment services. The bill would authorize the office to take certain actions in furtherance of this purpose.
(6) Existing law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, authorizes the imposition and collection of civil and criminal penalties for specified violations of that act. The act requires certain moneys, including General Fund revenues of penalties, collected pursuant to these provisions to be deposited in the State Water Pollution Cleanup and Abatement Account in the State Water Quality Control Fund. The act continuously appropriates the moneys in the account to the State Water Resources Control Board for specified cleanup programs.
The act authorizes the state board, upon application by a public agency, specified tribal governments, or not-for-profit organizations serving disadvantaged communities that have authority to clean up a waste or abate the effects of a waste to order moneys in the account to be paid to the entity to assist in cleaning up the waste or abating its effects on waters.
This bill would, until July 1, 2018, additionally authorize the state board to pay these moneys to a community water system that serves a disadvantaged community and would authorize moneys in the account to be used to assist in addressing an urgent drinking water need. By authorizing new expenditures from a continuously appropriated account, this bill would make an appropriation. The bill would exempt projects using moneys paid pursuant to these provisions from state contracting and procurement requirements, as specified, and would authorize the state board to adopt guidelines for the allocation and administration of moneys in the account that would be exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act.
(7) Existing law establishes the CalConserve Water Use Efficiency Revolving Fund and provides that the moneys in the fund are available to the Department of Water Resources, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the purpose of water use efficiency projects. Existing law requires moneys in the fund to be used for purposes that include, but are not limited to, at or below market interest rate loans to local agencies, as defined, and permits the department to enter into agreements with local agencies that provide water or recycled water service to provide loans.
Existing law, the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, approved by the voters as Proposition 1 at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds in the amount of $7,545,000,000 to finance a water quality, supply, and infrastructure improvement program. The bond act provides that the sum of $810,000,000 is to be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for expenditures on, and competitive grants and loans to, projects that are included in and implemented in an adopted integrated regional water management plan and respond to climate change and contribute to regional water security. The bond act authorizes the use of $100,000,000 of those funds for direct expenditures, and for grants and loans, for certain water conservation and water use efficiency plans, projects, and programs.
This bill would transfer to the CalConserve Water Use Efficiency Revolving Fund the sum of $10,000,000 of the proceeds of these bonds for water conservation and water use efficiency projects and programs to achieve urban water use targets. This bill would require the department to use $5,000,000 for a pilot project for local agencies to provide water efficiency upgrades to eligible residents. This bill would require the department to use the other $5,000,000 for local agencies to provide low-interest loans to customers to finance the installation of onsite improvements to repair or replace, as necessary, cracked or leaking water pipes to conserve water. The bill would authorize the department to provide local agencies with zero-interest loans of up to $3,000,000 and would require a local agency that receives a loan pursuant to these provisions to exercise reasonable efforts to recover the costs of the loan. The bill would also authorize the department to waive up to 10% of the repayment amount for costs that could not be recovered by a local agency.
(8) The State Contract Act generally provides for a contracting process by state agencies for public works of improvement pursuant to a competitive bidding process, under which bids are awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, with specified alternative bidding procedures authorized in certain cases.
Existing law, the California Emergency Services Act, sets forth the emergency powers of the Governor under its provisions and empowers the Governor to proclaim a state of emergency for certain conditions, including drought.

Pursuant to this authority, the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency, and a continued state of emergency, due to drought conditions and suspended certain statutes.
This bill would suspend the provisions of the Government Code and the Public Contract Code applicable to state contracts for purposes of state agencies implementing the Governor’s orders proclaiming a state of emergency as long as the state of emergency due to drought conditions remains in effect. The bill would specify that these suspensions only apply to contracts that respond to conditions arising from the drought and that support the state agencies in specified actions. The bill would require approval by the Department of Finance prior to the execution of any contract entered into pursuant to this provision and would require that certain information relating to these contracts be posted on the California Drought Internet Web site.
This bill would require an agency receiving moneys from one or more sources as appropriated pursuant to Assembly Bill 91 or Senate Bill 75 of the 2015–16 Regular Session to use the services of the California Conservation Corps or a certified community conservation corps, as defined, for restoration, ecosystem protection projects, or other similar work.

Prohibits the diversion from commencing until the department has determined that measures necessary to protect fishlife have been incorporated into the plans and construction of the diversion. Specifies that: (1) a person found to have violated such provisions shall be liable for a civil penalty of up to eight thousand dollars ($8,000) for each violation; and (2) all civil penalties imposed or collected by a court for a separate violation in connection with the production or cultivation of a controlled substance shall not be considered to be fines or forfeitures,"
"Existing law makes it a crime to import into the state for commercial purposes, to possess with intent to sell, or to sell within the state, the dead body, or any part or product thereof, of an elephant. Existing law exempts the possession with intent to sell, or sale of the dead body, or any part or product thereof, of any elephant before June 1, 1977, or the possession with intent to sell or the sale of any such item on or after June 1, 1977, if the item was imported before January 1, 1977.
This bill would delete this exemption. By changing the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would make it unlawful to purchase, sell, offer for sale, possess with intent to sell, or import with intent to sell ivory or rhinoceros horn, except as specified, and would make this prohibition enforceable by the Department of Fish and Wildlife. The bill would make a violation of this provision or any rule, regulation, or order adopted pursuant to this provision a misdemeanor subject to specified criminal penalties. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. In addition to the specified criminal penalties, the bill would authorize the department to impose an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 for a violation of this provision or any rule, regulation, or order adopted pursuant to this provision.
This bill would provide that the provisions of this bill are severable.
This bill would make these provisions operative on July 1, 2016.

Existing law establishes the Instructional Quality Commission and requires the commission to, among other things, recommend curriculum frameworks to the state board.
This bill would require the Superintendent to oversee the development of, and the state board to adopt, a model curriculum to ensure quality courses in ethnic studies. The bill would require the Instructional Quality Commission to advise, assist, and make recommendations to the Superintendent regarding the development of the model curriculum. The bill would, beginning the school year following the adoption of the model curriculum, require each school district maintaining grade 9 to offer to all otherwise qualified pupils in that grade, as an elective in the social sciences, a course of study in ethnic studies based on the model curriculum. By imposing additional duties on school districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
Existing law authorizes certain internship and fellowship programs, as specified.
This bill would establish the California Law Fellowship Program for the purpose of offering licensed attorneys and other qualifying law school graduates limited-term placements in public sector positions within state government as California Law Fellows, and encouraging each fellow to seek permanent public-sector employment at the conclusion of his or her fellowship, as specified.
Existing law, commonly known as the Code of Ethics, prohibits a Member of the Legislature or an employee of either house of the Legislature from receiving or agreeing to receive, directly or indirectly, any compensation, reward, or gift from any source except the State of California for any service, advice, assistance, or other matter related to the legislative process, except for specified circumstances.
This bill would provide that the services of a California Law Fellow are not compensation, a reward, or a gift to a Member of the Legislature for purposes of the so-called Code of Ethics. The bill would also provide that a participant in the program is not an employee of either house of the Legislature for purposes of the Code of Ethics.","This bill requires the Superintendent of Education and the state board of education to adopt a model curriculum to ensure quality courses of study in ethnic studies through partnerships with universities with ethnic studies programs. The model curriculum shall meet the A-G approval requirements of the University of California Instructional Quality Commission. Each school district maintaining grade 9 shall offer all otherwise qualified pupils in that grade, as an elective in the social sciences, a course of study in ethnic studies based on the model curriculum. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that it contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to a specified formula."
"The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law, including certain credits that are allowed in modified conformity to credits allowed by federal income tax laws. Federal income tax laws allow a refundable earned income tax credit for certain low-income individuals who have earned income and who meet certain other requirements.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, would allow an earned income credit against personal income tax, and a payment in excess of that amount, to an eligible individual that is equal to that portion of the earned income tax credit allowed by federal law as determined by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor as set forth in the annual Budget Act.
Existing law requires any bill authorizing a new personal income tax credit to contain, among other things, specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the tax credit will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data collection requirements, as provided.
To measure whether the earned income credit achieves its intended purpose, this bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to annually prepare a specified written report and to provide that report to specified legislative committees.
Existing law establishes the continuously appropriated Tax Relief and Refund Account, and provides that payments required to be made to taxpayers or other persons from the Personal Income Tax Fund are to be paid from that account.
By authorizing new payments from that account for amounts in excess of personal income tax liabilities, this bill would make an appropriation.
The Personal Income Tax Law imposes taxes based upon taxable income and also imposes interest and penalties with regard to those taxes under specified circumstances, including a penalty for the underpayment of estimated tax. Existing law provides no addition to tax shall be imposed to the extent that the underpayment was created or increased by any law that is chaptered during and operative for the taxable year of the underpayment.
This bill would provide that addition to tax shall not be imposed if the applicable percentage for the earned income tax credit for the taxable year was less than the applicable percentage for that credit for the preceding taxable year and would impose a penalty, in conformity with federal law, for failure to be diligent in determining eligibility for the earned income tax credit, as specified.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.
This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact statutory changes relating to the Budget Act of 2015.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 19, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to allow, beginning on January 1, 2015, a refundable income tax credit for an amount equal to earned income, as modified by this Act. Requires the amount of such credit to be multiplied by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor for the taxable year, as specified by this Act. (The earned income tax credit authorized by this Act shall only be operative for taxable years for which resources are authorized in the annual Budget Act for the Franchise Tax Board to oversee and audit returns associated with the credit.) Sets forth the earned income and phaseout amounts for the earned income credit, as well as the increased credit amount for three or more qualifying children."
"(1) Existing law, except as specified, prohibits any state agency from expending funds appropriated for design-build projects until the Department of Finance and the State Public Works Board have approved performance criteria or performance criteria and concept drawings for the project. Existing law, for these purposes, defines the term “performance criteria” to mean the information that fully describes the scope of the proposed project, as specified. Existing law, for these purposes, defines the term “concept drawings” to mean any schematic drawings or architectural renderings that are prepared, in addition to performance criteria, in the detail necessary to sufficiently describe the state’s needs.
This bill would revise the definition of “performance criteria,” for these purposes, to include concept drawings, as specified. The bill would additionally make conforming changes.
(2) Existing law establishes the State Public Works Board which consists of the Director of Finance, the Director of Transportation, and the Director of General Services. Existing law authorizes the Director of Transportation and the Director of General Services to appoint a deputy or assistant director in their respective departments to act in their place on the board, as specified.
This bill would repeal that authorization.
(3) Existing law requires the State Public Works Board to notify the Department of General Services whenever the revenues, rentals, or receipts from the operation of a public building that was acquired or constructed by the board are no longer required or pledged for the payment of principal or interest on any of the certificates or revenue bonds of the board. Existing law provides that thereafter, that public building is under the jurisdiction of, and operated and maintained by, the Department of General Services.
This bill would repeal this notification requirement and instead require those buildings to return to the jurisdiction of, and be operated and managed by, the state agency that had jurisdiction of the property prior to the board’s financing of the public building. The bill would additionally make conforming changes.
Existing law exempts from these provisions any public buildings that are acquired by lease by the board from a state agency, for the purposes of leasing the public building back to the state agency, as specified, and public buildings constructed for lease purchase to the University of California, the Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Maritime Academy, or any community college district. Existing law provides that when the revenues, rentals, or receipts from the operation of any public facility or public building are no longer required or pledged for the payment of principal or interest on the certificates or revenue bonds of the board, title to the public building vests in the Regents of the University of California, the Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Maritime Academy, or the community college district.
This bill would repeal these exemption and vesting provisions.
(4) Existing law, until July 1, 2015, authorizes the State Public Works Board to acquire public buildings by lease from any state agency, and to lease those public buildings back to the state agency and pledge the revenues, rentals, or receipts to the lease to secure repayment of revenue bonds, notes, or certificates issued by the board for the purpose of facilitating the financing of public buildings, as specified.
This bill would eliminate the repeal date and require the Department of Finance to report to the Legislature by June 30, 2017, on the effects of this repeal, as specified.
(5) Existing law requires all revenue bonds issued for state building construction to bear the signature of the Governor, and the facsimile countersignature of the Controller and the Treasurer, as specified. Existing law requires all interest coupons attached to each bond to bear the facsimile signature of the Treasurer, as specified. Existing law specifies that the rate of interest to be born by the bonds need not be uniform for all bonds of the same issue or series or division and provides that the rate may be determined and fixed by the State Public Works Board by resolution adopted at or after the sale of the bonds.
This bill would eliminate the requirement that all interest coupons attached to each bond bear the facsimile signature of the Treasurer and all references to interest coupons in these provisions. The bill would additionally provide that a “not to exceed” interest rate may be determined and fixed by the board by resolution adopted prior to or after the sale of the bonds.
(6) Existing law requires the highest bid received on the sale of the bonds to be determined by deducting the total amount of the premium bid, if any, from the total amount of the interest that the state would be required to pay from the date of the bonds or the last preceding interest payment date, whichever is latest, to the respective maturity date of the bonds, as specified, and requires the award to be made on the basis of the lowest net interest cost to the state. Existing law requires the Treasurer, upon receipt of a resolution of the State Public Works Board authorizing the issuance of bonds, to provide for the preparation of the bonds in accordance with the resolution. In the case of a public sale, existing law authorizes the Treasurer to sell the bonds at the time, and with the notice, determined by the Treasurer, upon sealed bids, to the bidder whose bid will result in the lowest net interest cost on account of the bonds.
This bill would instead authorize the Treasurer, for a public sale, to set forth the form and means of bids, and to sell to the bidder whose bid will result in the lowest interest cost to the state on account of the bonds. The bill would set forth the procedures the Treasurer may use to determine the lowest interest cost to the state, including the net interest cost of each bid, or the true interest cost of each bid, as defined.
(7) Existing law authorizes the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, participating counties, and the State Public Works Board to acquire, design, and construct local jail facilities approved by the Board of State and Community Corrections (BSCC). Existing law authorizes the State Public Works Board to issue revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes in the amounts of $365,771,000 and $854,229,000, in 2 phases, to finance the acquisition, design, and construction, and a reasonable construction reserve, of approved local jail facilities, as specified. Existing law authorizes the State Public Works Board to issue revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes in the amount of $500,000,000 to finance the acquisition, design, and construction, and a reasonable construction reserve, of approved adult local criminal justice facilities, as defined. The funds derived from those revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes are continuously appropriated for the purposes described above.
This bill would decrease the authorization for revenue bonds, notes, or bond anticipation notes in the first phase from $365,771,000 to $340,866,000 and increase the authorization of the 2nd phase from $854,229,000 to $870,074,000. The bill would also increase the authorization to be used for adult local criminal justice facilities from $500,000,000 to $509,060,000.
(8) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.","Amends the Government Code to prohibit the expenditure of funds appropriated for a design-build project by any State agency, including, but not limited to, the University of California, the California State University, the California Community Colleges, and the Judicial Council, until the Department of Finance and the State Public Works Board have approved performance criteria. Defines ""design-build project"" as a capital outlay project using the design-build construction procurement process in which both design and construction are procured from a single entity.Provides that amounts appropriated for a design-build project shall not be expended by any State agency, including, but not limited to, the University of California, the California State University, the California Community Colleges, and the Judicial Council, until the Department of Finance and the State Public Works Board have approved performance criteria."
"(1) The Public Employees’ Medical and Hospital Care Act (PEMHCA), which is administered by the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System, governs the funding and provision of postemployment health care benefits for eligible retired public employees and their families. PEMHCA defines “family member” for these purposes. PEMHCA authorizes the board to contract with carriers offering health benefit plans and prohibits employees, annuitants, and their family members who are eligible for Medicare, as specified, from enrolling in a basic health benefit plan. PEMHCA requires the board to make certain notifications and reports to the Legislature in connection with health benefit plans offered pursuant to its provisions.
This bill would clarify the definition of family for the purposes of PEMHCA by specifically excluding former spouses and former domestic partners. The bill would require the employing office, as specified, of a state employee or state annuitant, pursuant to standards established by the Department of Human Resources, to possess documentation verifying eligibility of an employee’s family member prior to the enrollment of a family member in a health benefit plan and to verify continued eligibility pursuant to a specified schedule. The bill would prohibit the board from granting further exceptions to the rule against enrolling in employees, annuitants, and their family members who are eligible for Medicare, as specified, in a basic health benefit plan. The bill would revise the entities to which the board is required to provide notification of approval of proposed benefit and premium readjustments to exclude the Legislature as a whole and to instead require provision of an initial estimate of proposed changes in writing to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, the chairpersons of the committees and subcommittees in each house of the Legislature that consider the Public Employees’ Retirement System’s budget and activities, the State Controller, the Director of Finance, and the Legislative Analyst. The bill would specify the latest date that this notification may take place. The bill would require the board to provide a specified, detailed report to the Legislature and the Director of Finance annually, on November 1, regarding the health benefit plans it provides.
(2) PEMHCA establishes the Annuitants’ Health Care Coverage Fund, which is continuously appropriated for the purpose of prefunding of health care coverage for annuitants, including administrative costs. PEMHCA defines “prefunding” for these purposes.
This bill would prohibit the use of certain state funds in the Annuitants’ Health Care Coverage Fund for the payment of benefits until the earlier of 2 specified dates. The bill would revise the definition of prefunding to include employee as well as employer payments and to provide that payments may fund the actuarially determined normal costs of postemployment health care benefits. By providing a new funding source for a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation.
(3) Existing law prescribes the duties of the Controller, which generally regard supervision of the fiscal concerns of the state. Existing law requires the Controller to abolish a state position that is vacant for 6 consecutive monthly pay periods on the following July 1, and permits the Director of Finance to authorize reestablishment of a position abolished pursuant to this authority under certain conditions. Among other things, existing law requires the Controller to reestablish a position abolished pursuant to this authority if the director of the department in which that position existed prior to abolishment makes a certification by August 15, as specified.
This bill would repeal the provisions pertaining to vacant positions described above.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.
This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact statutory changes relating to the Budget Act of 2015.","Repeals a provision of the Government Code which requires the abolishment of any California State position that is vacant for six consecutive monthly pay periods, except for those positions exempt from civil service or those instructional and instruction-related positions authorized for the California State University. Allows the reestablishment of any such positions if one or more of the following conditions existed during part or all of the six consecutive pay periods: (1) there was a hiring freeze in effect during part or all of the six consecutive pay periods; (2) the department has diligently attempted to fill the position but was unable to complete all the steps necessary to fill the position within six months; (3) the position has been designated as a management position for purposes of collective bargaining and has been held vacant pending the appointment of the director, or other chief executive officer, of the department as part of the transition from one Governor to the succeeding Governor; (4) the classification of the position is determined to be hard-to-fill; (5) late enactment of the budget causes the department to delay filling the position; (6) the position is necessary for directly providing 24-hour care in an institution operated by the State; (7) the position is necessary for the State to satisfy any licensing requirements adopted by a local, State, or Federal licensing or other regulatory agency; (8)"
"(1) The California Constitution provides that the civil service includes every officer and employee in the state except as otherwise provided in the Constitution, and existing statutory law, the State Civil Service Act, prescribes a comprehensive civil service personnel system for the state. The act grants eligibility for promotional civil service examinations and career executive assignment examinations to persons who meet certain requirements and minimum qualifications and who are employed by the Legislature, persons who are retired from the United States armed forces, honorably discharged from active military duty with a service-connected disability, or honorably discharged from active duty, or persons who were employees of the executive branch in exempt positions.
This bill would revise eligibility standards applicable to people who were employed by the Legislature, people who retired or were discharged from the armed forces, and people who were formerly employed in exempt, executive branch positions, as described above, to permit them, upon request, to obtain civil service appointment list eligibility by taking promotional exams or career executive exams for which they meet minimum qualifications, as specified. The bill would eliminate the requirement that an employee or veteran, in this context, select only one promotional examination in which to compete when multiple examinations are given. Among other things, the bill would also remove a time limit on this eligibility granted to specified former employees of the Legislature and employees of the executive branch in exempt positions.
(2) Existing law generally requires that appointments to vacant positions be made by lists. Existing law requires, with specified exceptions, that an appointing power receive the names and addresses of the three persons highest on a promotional employment list for the class in which a position belongs, and if there are fewer than three names, as specified, additional names are provided from the various lists next lower in order of preference. Existing law prescribes requirements for providing names to an appointing power for positions designated as management and specifies a method of ranking eligible candidates in this context. Existing law prescribes requirements for providing names to an appointing power for positions designated as supervisory and not professional, scientific, or administrative, and that are not examined for on an open basis, and specifies a method of ranking eligible candidates in this context. Existing law requires an appointing power to fill a position from the names of the persons provided.
This bill would repeal these provisions and make conforming changes.
(3) Existing law provides for career executive assignments to encourage the development for well-qualified executives and requires the State Personnel Board to establish, by a rule, a system of merit personnel administration specifically suited to the selection and placement of executive personnel. The State Civil Service Act defines career executive. Existing law requires the State Personnel Board, by rule, to provide that employees whose appointments to career executive assignments are terminated to be reinstated to civil service positions, as specified, at their option.
This bill would revise the definition of career executive to eliminate the requirement that the person have permanent status in the civil service. This bill would provide that various provisions relating to personnel examinations don’t apply to career executive assignments unless provided for by rule, as specified. The bill would grant reinstatement rights to employees who at the time of appointment to a career executive assignment were not employed by the state but who had previously worked for it and had gained permanent civil service status. The bill would grant an employee who at the time of his or her appointment to a career executive assignment
did not have
was from outside
civil service
status eligibility to compete in any promotional examination for which he or she meets the minimum qualifications as prescribed by the class specification, except as specified, and would provide these employees other rights in this context, including
the right to defer
examinations and to transfer list eligibility in the same manner as civil service employees.
examination for any open eligible list, as specified, in existence at the time of the termination of the career executive assignment for which he or she meets the minimum qualifications of the class to which appointment is sought. The bill would require, in this regard, that related experience gained in a career executive assignment be considered state civil service experience in a comparable class, as specified.
The bill would make an appropriation from the General Fund of $300,000 to the Department of Finance for the purpose of funding the posting on the department’s Internet Web site of all budget requests included as part of the Governor’s Budget.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.","(Sec. 2) Provides that persons employed by the Legislature for two or more consecutive years shall be given an opportunity, upon request, to obtain civil service appointment list eligibility by taking any promotional civil service examination or career executive assignment examinations for which they meet minimum qualifications of the class to which they seek appointment. Requires persons receiving passing scores in such examinations to be considered state civil service experience in a comparable class that has the same or substantially similar duties and responsibilities as the persons position in the military.(Sec. 3) Makes persons retired from the United States military, honorably discharged from active military duty with a service-connected disability or honorably discharged from active duty eligible to apply for promotional civil service examinations and career executive assignment examinations for which they meet the minimum qualifications of the class to which they seek appointment. Requires persons receiving passing scores in such examinations to be considered state civil service experience in a comparable class that has the same or substantially similar duties and responsibilities as the persons position in the military.(Sec. 4) Provides that persons holding, for two or more consecutive years, nonelected civil service positions in the executive branch shall be given the opportunity, upon request, to obtain civil service appointment eligibility by taking any promotional civil service examination or career executive assignment examination for which they meet"
"Existing law authorizes the Treasurer or chief fiscal officer of a campus of the California State University to invest certain money received by the California State University in eligible securities and in investment certificates or withdrawal shares in federal or state credit unions doing business in this state as long as any money invested in this manner is fully insured by the National Credit Union Administration.
This bill would authorize the Treasurer or chief fiscal officer of a campus of the California State University to invest
certain of those moneys
that money
in mutual funds subject to registration by, and under the regulatory authority of, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or in real estate investment trusts. The bill would impose specified requirements on the Trustees of the California State University relating to those types of investments.
Existing law establishes the California State University Special Projects Fund, which consists of grants, revenues, and funds for the operation, support, and development of research, workshops, conferences, institutes, and special projects in the California State University. Existing law authorizes the Treasurer to invest money from the fund in eligible securities.
This bill would authorize the Treasurer or chief fiscal officer of a campus of the California State University to invest the money in the California State University Special Projects Fund in mutual funds subject to registration by, and under the regulatory authority of, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or in real estate investment trusts.
This bill would limit the total amount invested in these mutual funds and real estate investment trusts to specified amounts for each fiscal year, until, commencing with the 2019–20 fiscal year, up to 30% of that money could be invested in these asset categories.","Amends the Education Code to revise requirements for the support of the California State University with respect to money received from the sale of university publications, student fees, agreements, and gifts and dispositions of personal property. Provides that all such money shall be appropriated for the support of the University in addition to other amounts appropriated by the Legislature. <n>Allows all such money to be invested, upon approval of the trustees of the university, in eligible securities listed in the Government Code. Allows such money also to be invested, upon approval of the trustees, in mutual funds subject to registration by, and under the regulatory authority of, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or in real estate investment trusts. Requires all interest and other earnings received pursuant to such investment to be established by the trustees consistent with the terms and conditions of the gift, bequest, devise, donation, or agreement. <n>Appropriates all money received from the sale or disposition of real property acquired by or on behalf of a campus of the University for the acquisition and improvement of real property for the campus."

"Existing law prescribes the minimum requirements for a clear multiple or single subject teaching credential, including the completion of either a beginning teacher induction program approved by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and the Superintendent of Public Instruction pursuant to the Marian Bergeson Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment System, an alternative program of beginning teacher induction that is provided by one or more local educational agencies and has been approved by the commission and the Superintendent on the basis of initial review and periodic evaluations of the program in relation to appropriate standards of credential program quality and effectiveness that have been adopted by the commission, the Superintendent, and the State Board of Education, as provided, or an alternative program of beginning teacher induction that is sponsored by a regionally accredited college or university, in cooperation with one or more local school districts, that addresses the individual professional needs of beginning teachers and meets the commission’s standards of induction, except as provided. Existing law also requires credentials for teaching specialties, including, but not limited to, bilingual education, early childhood education, and special education, to be based upon a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution, completion of a program of professional preparation, and any other standards which the commission may establish.
This bill would, commencing with hiring for the 2016–17 school year, and each school year thereafter, prohibit a school district, county office of education, or charter school from charging a fee to a beginning teacher to participate in a beginning teacher induction program that is approved by the commission and the Superintendent, and would define a beginning teacher for purposes of that provision to include a teacher with a preliminary multiple or single subject teaching credential, or a preliminary education specialist credential. The bill also would prohibit a local educational agency from charging a fee to a beginning teacher to participate in an alternative program of beginning teacher induction program that it provides, and would prohibit a school district from charging a fee to a beginning teacher to participate in an alternative program of beginning teacher induction that is sponsored by a regionally accredited college or university, in cooperation with one or more local school districts.","This bill amends the Education Code to require all programs of professional preparation for multiple or single subject teaching credentials to be accredited by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, except those that include more than two years of full-time study.

"(1) Existing law, the California Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, provides for a system of classification of those rivers or segments of rivers in the state that are designated as wild, scenic, or recreational rivers, for purposes of preserving the highest and most beneficial use of those rivers. The act requires the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency to study and submit to the Governor and the Legislature a report that analyzes the suitability or nonsuitability for addition to the system of rivers or segments of rivers that are designated by the Legislature as potential additions to the system, and requires that each report contain specified information and recommendations with respect to the proposed designation.
This bill would require the secretary, in a report analyzing the suitability or nonsuitability of a proposed designation of the Mokelumne River, its tributaries, or segments thereof as additions to the system, to consider the potential effects of the proposed designation on future water requirements, as specified, and the effects of climate change on river values and current and projected water supplies, and to consider other factors. The bill would include any segment of the Mokelumne River designated for potential addition within certain protections afforded to wild and scenic rivers until the completion of the study period and the implementation of any recommendation to add the segment of the Mokelumne River to the system, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurs first.
The bill would also designate specified segments of the Mokelumne River for potential addition to the system. The bill would require the secretary to submit a report pursuant to the above-described requirements to the Legislature and Governor no later than December 31, 2017, and would require the report to include a clear recommendation on the suitability or nonsuitability for addition to the system of each of the designated segments of the Mokelumne River. The bill would require the secretary to enter into a cost-sharing agreement with the Upper Mokelumne River Watershed Authority that would require the state and the authority to each pay a specified portion of the cost of the report. By imposing new duties on a local government entity, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) The bill would declare that due to the unique geographical features of the Mokelumne River and its tributaries, a general statute within the meaning of specified provisions of the California Constitution cannot be made applicable and a special statute is necessary.
(3)The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Public Resources Code to require the Department of the Interior, prior to the designation of specified segments of the Mokelumne River, its tributaries, or segments thereof as additions to the Wild and Scenic Rivers system, to study and submit a report that analyzes the suitability or nonsuitability of the proposed designation.

"Existing law, the California Retail Food Code, establishes uniform health and sanitation standards for retail food facilities, as defined. Existing law exempts from the definition of food facility premises set aside for wine tasting, regardless of whether there is a charge for the wine tasting, if no other beverage, except for bottles of wine and prepackaged nonpotentially hazardous beverages, is offered for sale for onsite consumption and no food, except for crackers, is served. Existing law prohibits certain premises from having a food display area that exceeds 25 square feet, and subjects certain facilities or premises with a food display area of 25 square feet or less to specified provisions of the code. Existing law imposes certain enforcement duties on the State Department of Public Health, but provides that local health agencies are primarily responsible for enforcing these provisions. A person who violates any provision of the code is guilty of a misdemeanor, except as otherwise provided.
This bill would additionally exclude from the definition of food facility a premises set aside for wine tasting that offers pretzels or prepackaged nonpotentially hazardous food for sale or for onsite consumption. The bill would limit the food display area in premises set aside for wine tasting to 25 square feet and subject those premises to specified provisions of the California Retail Food Code. By imposing new duties on local health agencies, and by expanding the definition of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law, for the purposes of the California Retail Food Code, defines “community event” to mean an event that is of a civic, political, public, or educational nature.
This bill would limit the definition of a community event to include only an event of a civic, political, public, or educational nature conducted for not more than 25 consecutive or nonconsecutive days in a 90-day period.
Under existing law, a permanent food facility is required to provide clean toilet facilities in good repair for consumers, guests, and invitees, except that a building constructed before January 1, 2004, that has a food facility that provides space for the consumption of food on the premises may either provide clean toilet facilities in good repair or prominently post a sign in a public area stating that toilet facilities are not provided.
This bill would limit the above exemption to food facilities that have been in continuous operation since January 1, 2004.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code, with respect to food facilities, to revise the definition of &quot;facilities.&quot; The bill excludes from the definition: cooperative arrangements wherein no permanent facilities are used for storing or handling food; private homes; church, private club, or other nonprofit associations that give or sell food to its members and guests at an event that occurs not more than 25 consecutive or nonconsecutive days in a 90-day period and that is of a civic, political, public, or educational nature; nonprofit entities that give or sell food at an event that occurs not more than three days in a 90-day period for the benefit of a nonprofit association, if the for-profit entity receives no monetary benefit; wine premises; beer premises; and residential care facilities for the chronically ill. Food facilities shall provide clean toilet facilities for consumers, guests, or invitees when there is onsite consumption of foods or when the facility was constructed after July 1, 1984, and has more than 20,000 square feet of floor space."
"Existing law prohibits dumping waste matter in or upon a public or private highway or road, or in or upon private property into or upon which the public is admitted by easement or license, or upon private property without the consent of the owner, or in or upon a public park or other public property. A violation of these provisions is an infraction punishable by a fine between $250 and $1,000 for a first conviction, between $500 and $1,500 for a 2nd conviction, and between $750 and $3,000 for a 3rd or subsequent conviction.
This bill would make dumping waste matter on private property, including on any private road or highways, without the consent of the owner punishable by a fine between $250 and $1,000 for a first conviction, between $500 and $1,500 for a 2nd conviction, and between $750 and $3,000 for a 3rd conviction. The bill would make a 4th or subsequent conviction a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 30 days and by a fine of not less than $750 nor more than $3,000.
By changing the definition of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Makes it unlawful to: (1) dump or cause to be dumped waste matter in or upon a public highway or road, including any portion of the right-of-way thereof, or in or upon private property into or upon a public park or other public property other than property designated or set aside for that purpose by the governing board or body having charge of that property; and (2) place, deposit, or dump, or cause to be placed, deposited, or dumped, rocks, concrete, asphalt, or other waste matter in or upon a private highway or road, including any portion of the right-of-way of the private highway or road, or private property, without the consent of the owner or contractor for the materials, or in or upon a public park or other public property, without the consent of the state or local agency having jurisdiction over the highway, road, or property.

"Existing law, the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, prohibits a person from introducing into interstate commerce any new drug unless the drug has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Existing law requires the sponsor of a new drug to submit to the FDA an investigational new drug application and to then conduct a series of clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug in human populations and submit the results to the FDA in a new drug application.
Existing law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, regulates the packaging, labeling, and advertising of drugs and devices and is administered by the State Department of Public Health. A violation of that law is a crime. The Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law prohibits, among other things, the sale, delivery, or giving away of a new drug or new device unless either the department has approved a new drug or device application for that new drug or new device and that approval has not been withdrawn, terminated, or suspended or the drug or device has been approved pursuant to specified provisions of federal law, including the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
The Medical Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians and surgeons by the Medical Board of California and requires the board to take action against a licensee who is charged with unprofessional conduct. The Osteopathic Act provides for the licensure and regulation of osteopathic physicians and surgeons by the Osteopathic Medical Board of California and requires the board to enforce the Medical Practice Act with respect to its licensees.
This bill would permit a manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological product, or device to make the product available to eligible patients with an immediately life-threatening disease or condition, as specified. The bill would authorize, but not require, a health benefit plan, as defined, to provide coverage for any investigational drug, biological product, or device made available pursuant to these provisions. The bill would prohibit the Medical Board of California and the Osteopathic Medical Board of California from taking any disciplinary action against the license of a physician based solely on the physician’s recommendation to an eligible patient regarding, or prescription for or treatment with, an investigational drug, biological product, or device if the recommendation or prescription is consistent with protocol approved by the physician’s institutional review board or an accredited institutional review board, and would require the institutional review board to biannually report specified information to the State Department of Public Health, among others. The bill would prohibit a state agency from altering any recommendation made to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding a health care provider’s certification to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid program based solely on the recommendation from an individual health care provider that a patient have access to an investigational drug, biological product, or device.","Right to Try Act - Requires a primary physician and an osteopathic physician licensed under the Medical Practice Act or an osteopathic physician licensed under the Osteopathic Act to Confirm, in writing, that an eligible patient is competent, acting voluntarily, and has made an informed decision if the physician determines that such patient: (1) has an immediately life-threatening disease or condition; (2) has considered all other treatment options currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); (3) has not been accepted to participate in the nearest clinical trial to his or her home for such disease or condition within one week of completion of the clinical trial application process; (4) has received a recommendation from his or her primary physician and a consulting physician for an investigational drug, biological product, or device; (5) has given written informed consent for the use of such investigational drug, biological product, or device; and (6) has documentation from his or her primary physician and a consulting physician attesting that the patient has met the requirements of this Act.

"Existing law, the California Control of Profits of Organized Crime Act, provides the procedure for the forfeiture of property and proceeds acquired through a pattern of criminal profiteering activity, as specified, and requires the prosecution to file a petition for forfeiture in conjunction with certain criminal charges. Under existing law, criminal profiteering activity is defined to include specified crimes, including forgery and offenses relating to counterfeit of a registered mark. Existing law also defines organized crime for the purposes of these provisions as including, among other things, specified crimes that are of a conspiratorial nature and are either of an organized nature and seek to supply illegal goods and services or crimes that, through planning and coordination of individual efforts, seek to conduct specified illegal activities.
This bill would include within the definition of criminal profiteering activity offenses relating to piracy, and insurance fraud, as specified. The bill would also broaden the definition of organized crime to include pimping and pandering, counterfeiting of a registered mark, piracy of a recording or audiovisual work, embezzlement, securities fraud, grand theft, money laundering, and forgery. By increasing the burdens on local prosecuting agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law, the Sales and Use Tax Law, imposes a tax on retailers measured by the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property sold at retail in this state, or on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer for storage, use, or other consumption in this state. Existing law provides that a “retail sale” or “sale at retail” includes any sale by a convicted seller, as defined, of tangible personal property with a counterfeit mark on, or in connection with, that sale, regardless of whether the sale is for resale in the regular course of business. Existing law provides that “storage” or “use” includes a purchase by a convicted purchaser, as defined, of tangible personal property with a counterfeit mark on, or in connection with, that purchase, regardless of whether the purchase is for resale in the regular course of business.
Under this bill, a “retail sale” or “sale at retail” additionally would include any sale by a convicted seller of tangible personal property with a counterfeit label or an illicit label, as specified. The bill similarly would provide that “storage” and “use” additionally would include a purchase by a convicted purchaser of tangible personal property with a counterfeit label or an illicit label, as specified.
The Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing law authorizes districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to state sales and use taxes are incorporated into these laws.
The amendments made by this bill would be incorporated into these laws.
This bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIII A of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of
2/3
of the membership of each house of the Legislature.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on March 19, 2003.

"Existing law authorizes the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, among other things, to establish professional standards, assessments, and examinations for entry and advancement in the education profession. Existing law requires the commission, upon recommendation by a tribal government of a federally recognized Indian tribe in California, to issue an American Indian languages credential to a candidate who has demonstrated fluency in that tribal language and met other requirements.
This bill would instead require the commission, upon recommendation by a tribal government of a federally recognized Indian tribe in California, to issue an American Indian language-culture credential with an American Indian language authorization, or an American Indian culture authorization, or both, to a candidate who has met specified requirements. The bill would authorize the holder of an American Indian language-culture credential to teach the American Indian language, or culture, or both, for which the credential was issued in California public schools in preschool, kindergarten, grades 1 to 12, inclusive, and in adult education courses, and would make the holder of that credential eligible for a clear teaching credential after 5 years, upon application and the recommendation of the tribal government, as specified. The bill would encourage each federally recognized American Indian tribe to develop a written and oral assessment that should be successfully completed before an applicant is recommended for an American Indian language-culture credential with an American Indian language authorization, American Indian culture authorization, or both, as provided.","Amends the Education Code to require the California Education Commission, upon recommendation of the tribal government of a federally recognized Indian tribe, to issue an American Indian language-culture credential to a candidate who has demonstrated: (1) in that tribe's language based on an assessment developed and administered by that tribe; and (2) knowledge in that tribe's culture based on an assessment developed and administered by that tribe.

"Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health to establish a program for the development, provision, and evaluation of genetic disease testing, and the program is required to provide genetic screening and followup services for persons who have the screening. The program includes statewide screening of newborn children through the collection of blood samples, unless the parent or guardian objects on the grounds of religious beliefs or practices.
This bill would require the department to provide information about the testing program, and to obtain a form signed by the parent or guardian acknowledging receiving information regarding the storage, retention, and use of the newborn child’s blood sample for medical research. The bill would authorize a parent or guardian of a minor child, and the newborn child, once he or she is at least 18 years of age, to request that the department destroy the blood sample, not use it for research purposes, or both, and the bill would require the department to comply with the request.
The bill would require the department, if the individual making a request to destroy the blood sample or to not use it for research purposes provides his or her e-mail address, to send an e-mail to the individual acknowledging that the department received the request.
The bill would also require the department to prepare and provide informational materials regarding the same information about the newborn child’s blood sample collected pursuant to the program, information on storage, retention, and use of the blood sample for medical research, and the right of specified persons to request that the blood sample be destroyed or not used for research purposes in a separate, single-page format. The bill would also require the department to prepare and provide a standard informational acceptance form, that includes, among other things, a brief, plain language explanation of, and the purpose for, the newborn child screening test and retention of newborn child blood samples. The bill would require the informational acceptance form to be provided to, and signed by, the parent or guardian when either version of the informational materials is provided. The bill would require specified persons to distribute the informational material and the informational acceptance form, including requiring the local registrar of births to provide a copy of the informational material and a copy of the standard informational acceptance form to each person registering the birth of a newborn that occurred outside of a perinatal licensed health facility, as specified. The bill would also require the local registrar to notify the local health officer and the department of each of these registrations by the local registrar. By imposing additional duties on local registrars of births, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

"Existing law provides a procedure for the appointment of a conservator for a person who is determined to be gravely disabled as a result of a mental disorder or an impairment by chronic alcoholism, and requires an officer, including a county public guardian or a county mental health program, to conduct a conservatorship investigation and render a written report to the court of his or her investigation. Under existing law, a professional person in charge of an agency providing comprehensive evaluation or a facility providing intensive treatment for a gravely disabled person may recommend a conservatorship for that person, and the agency is required to disclose any records or information that may facilitate an investigation. Existing law requires the officer providing conservatorship investigation, when he or she concurs with the recommendation of the professional person or facility, to petition the superior court in the patient’s county of residence for a conservatorship. Existing law also provides for the establishment of a conservatorship for a person who is unable to properly provide for his or her personal needs or is substantially unable to manage his or her finances.
This bill would authorize the court, if a conservatorship has already been established under the Probate Code, and after a hearing attended by the conservatee, unless he or she waives presence, and the conservatee’s counsel, to order an investigation from the officer providing conservatorship investigation if the court, in consultation with a licensed physician or psychologist, as specified, providing comprehensive evaluation or intensive treatment, determines, in a specified proceeding, that the conservatee may be gravely disabled as a result of a mental disorder or impairment by chronic alcoholism and is unwilling to accept, or is incapable of accepting, treatment voluntarily. The bill would also require the court to appoint counsel to a conservatee if he or she cannot afford counsel. The bill would require the officer providing conservatorship investigation to petition the superior court in the patient’s county of residence to establish conservatorship if he or she concurs with the conservatorship investigation order of the court, and to file a copy of his or her report with the court. The bill would require a conservator to disclose any records or information that may facilitate the investigation. The bill would also make conforming changes.
By expanding the duties of the county officer providing conservatorship investigation, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code and the Probate Code, respectively, to require that reasonable attempts shall be made by the county mental health program to notify family members, or any other person designated to receive notice by the person for whom conservatorship is sought, of the time and place of the conservatorship hearing. <n>Provides that if the professional person in charge of an agency providing comprehensive evaluation or a facility providing intensive treatment determines that a person in his or her care is gravely disabled as a result of mental disorder or impairment and is unwilling to accept, or incapable of accepting, treatment voluntarily, he or she may recommend conservatorship of the person to the officer providing conservatorship investigation of the person's friends, social worker, or principal therapist. <n>Allows the professional person in charge of an agency providing comprehensive evaluation or a facility providing intensive treatment to recommend conservatorship for a person without the person being an inpatient in the facility if both of the following conditions are met: (1) the professional person or another professional person designated by him or her has examined and evaluated the person and determined that future examination on an inpatient basis is not necessary for a determination that the person is gravely disabled; and (2) the professional person or another professional person designated by him or her has determined that future examination"

The bill would delete the requirement that the facilities be consistent with the established standards, requirements, and limitations that apply to specified facilities and would instead require the commission to establish eligibility criteria set forth in guidelines for the development and operation of the facilities and provide for the review and approval by the commission of each proposed toll facility pursuant to those eligibility criteria. The bill would require toll facilities approved by the commission on or after January 1, 2016, to be subject to specified minimum requirements, including those relating to toll facility revenues. The bill would authorize a regional transportation agency or the state, as applicable, to issue bonds, refunding bonds, or bond anticipation notes backed by revenues generated from the facilities.

The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 requires the State Air Resources Board to adopt regulations to require the reporting and verification of statewide greenhouse gas emissions and to monitor and enforce compliance with the act.
This bill would require the state board to make available, and update at least annually, on its Internet Web site the emissions of greenhouse gases, criteria pollutants, and toxic air contaminants for each facility that reports to the state board and air districts. The bill would require the state board, at least once a year at a hearing of the Joint Legislative Committee on Climate Change Policies, to present an informational report on the reported emissions of greenhouse gases, criteria pollutants, and toxic air contaminants from all sectors covered by the scoping plan, as specified.
This bill would require the state board to make available, and update at least annually, on its Internet Web site the emissions of greenhouse gases, criteria pollutants, and toxic air contaminants throughout the state broken down to a local and subcounty level for stationary sources and to at least a county level for mobile sources, as specified.
(3) The act requires the board to approve a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020. The act requires the state board to prepare and approve a scoping plan for achieving the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
This bill would require the state board, when adopting rules and regulations to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions beyond the statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit and to protect the state’s most impacted and disadvantaged communities, to follow specified requirements, consider the social costs of the emissions of greenhouse gases, and prioritize specified emission reduction rules and regulations.
This bill would require the state board, when updating the scoping plan, to identify specified information for each emissions reduction measure, including each alternative compliance mechanism, market-based compliance mechanism, and potential monetary and nonmonetary incentive.

Existing law authorizes, in each county where more than one oversight board was created, only one oversight board to be appointed on and after July 1, 2016.
This bill would require an oversight board within the County of Los Angeles to continue to independently operate past the July 1, 2016, consolidation date, until its successor agency adopts a resolution dissolving the board and the board approves that resolution, as provided.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles.","Directs each successor agency in Los Angeles County, California, to have an oversight board composed of their members as the type of eligible territorial jurisdiction to receive property tax revenues pursuant to the Health and Safety Code, with one of their successor agencies the largest special district in the former redevelopment agency's largest territorial jurisdiction."

Existing law requires the local law enforcement agency with which the property is registered to respond as soon as practicable after being notified that an unauthorized person has been found on the property and take specified action, including requiring a person who is found on the property to produce written authorization to be on the property or other evidence demonstrating the person’s right to possession, and notifying any person who does not produce that authorization or other evidence that the owner or owner’s agency may seek to obtain a court order and that the person will be subject to arrest for trespass if he or she is subsequently found on the property in violation of that order.
This bill would extend the residential property subject to these provisions to include the City of Eureka in the County of Humboldt, the City of Fairfield in the City of Solano, and the Counties of Humboldt and Lake. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury and by imposing new duties on local law enforcement agencies, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.

Declares that all laws regarding the confidentiality of health care information and patient's rights shall apply to telehealth interactions."
"Existing law requires that, except as specified, not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages, determined by the Director of Industrial Relations, be paid to workers employed on public works projects. Existing law defines “public works” to include, among other things, construction, alteration, demolition, installation, or repair work done under contract and paid for, in whole or in part, out of public funds, but exempts from that definition, among other projects, an otherwise private development project if the state or political subdivision provides, directly or indirectly, a public subsidy to the private development project that is de minimis in the context of the project.
This bill would provide that a public subsidy is de minimis if it is both less than $250,000 and less than 2% of the total project cost. The bill would specify that those provisions do not apply to a project that was advertised for bid, or a contract that was awarded, before July 1, 2016.","This bill amends the Labor Code to redefine &quot;public work&quot; in California as: (1) construction, alteration, demolition, installation, or repair work done under contract and paid for in whole or part out of public funds, except work done directly by any public utility company pursuant to order of the Public Utilities Commission or other public authority; (2) work done for irrigation, utility, reclamation, and improvement districts and other districts; (3) street, sewer, or other improvement work done under the direction and supervision or by the authority of any officer or public body of the state, or of any political subdivision or district thereof; (4) the laying of carpet done under a lease-maintenance contract and paid for out of public funds; (5) public transportation demonstration projects authorized pursuant to the Streets and Highways Code; (6) infrastructure project grants from the California Advanced Services Fund; and (7) public transportation demonstration projects authorized pursuant to the Public Utilities Code. The bill defines &quot;money&quot; as: (1) the payment of money or the equivalent of money directly or on behalf of the public works contractor, subcontractor, or developer; (2) performance of construction work by the state or political subdivision in execution of a contract that is not to be repaid on an asset of value for less than fair market price;"
"Existing law, the Mental Health Services Act, an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, establishes the Mental Health Services Fund to fund various county mental health programs, and establishes the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission, which consists of 16 members, to oversee the administration of various parts of the act. Existing law authorizes the act to be amended by a
2/3
vote of the Legislature if the amendments are consistent with, and further the purposes of, the act.
This bill would expand the commission by 2 additional members who each have specified mental health knowledge and experience, to be appointed by the Governor. By amending the provisions of the Mental Health Services Act, this bill requires a
2/3
vote of the Legislature.
Existing law, the Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention Bond Act of 2014 (bond act), an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 41 at the June 3, 2014, primary election, authorized $600 million in bonds to provide multifamily housing to low-income veterans and supportive housing for homeless veterans, through the Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention Act of 2014. Existing law, the Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention Act of 2014, provides for the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable multifamily supportive housing, affordable transitional housing, affordable rental housing, and related facilities for veterans and their families to allow veterans to access and maintain housing stability. Existing law requires the California Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Housing and Community Development, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, to work collaboratively for those purposes.
This bill would require those departments to give a preference to applicants for funding pursuant to the bond act for supportive housing projects when the applicant can demonstrate a multiyear commitment of Mental Health Services Act funding for the applicant’s housing project funding plan.
Existing law requires county mental health plans, whether administered by public or private entities, to be governed by specified guidelines, including, among other things, providing for culturally competent and age-appropriate services, to the extent feasible. Existing law requires a mental health plan to have a cultural competence plan with specified components.
This bill would require the Department of Health Care Services to

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Military and Veterans Code to require the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs to give a preference to applicants for funding from the Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention Bond Act of 2014 for housing projects when the applicant can demonstrate a multiyear commitment of Mental Health Services Act funding for the applicant's project funding plan. The bill establishes the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission to: oversee the review, training, accountability, and evaluation for the use of funds received from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development of the Department of Health Care Services; oversee the development of strategies to overcome stigma and discrimination related to mental illness; and develop strategies to improve the quality of care and services provided by state and local mental health agencies."
"Existing law establishes election dates in each year, which are the second Tuesday of April in each even-numbered year, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March of each odd-numbered year, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in June in each year, and the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of each year.
This bill would, commencing January 1, 2020, eliminate the established election dates in March and April.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on September 25, 2019. This bill expresses the intent of the Legislature that California should: (1) encourage increased voter participation, and (2) not alter the date of a runoff election provided for in the principal act of a district. (Sec. 2) The bill amends the California Elections Code to establish the second Tuesday of April in each even-numbered year and the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March and November of each year as the dates for general municipal elections. The bill also revises the date of general municipal elections to establish the same day as the statewide direct primary election, the day of the statewide general election, or the day of school district elections. (Sec. 4) A city council may enact an ordinance requiring its general municipal election to be held the same day as: (1) the statewide direct primary election, the day of the statewide general election, or the day of school district elections, as set forth in this bill."
"Existing law requires an agency that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information, as defined, to provide notification of any breach in the security of that data to any California resident whose personal information may have been compromised by the breach, as specified. Existing law requires the notification to be written in plain language and contain specified information, including, but not limited to, the agency’s contact information and a list of the types of personal information that were or are reasonably believed to have been the subject of the breach.
This bill would additionally require an agency, if the agency was the source of the breach and the breach compromised a person’s social security number, driver’s license number, or California identification card number, to offer to provide the person with identity theft prevention and mitigation services at no cost for not less than 12 months, as specified.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Civil Code to require any agency that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information to: (1) disclose any breach of the security of the system following discovery or notification of the breach to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person; and (2) notify the owner or licensee of any breach of the security of such data immediately following discovery if the personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. Prohibits any such notification from being delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that it will impede a criminal investigation. Sets forth requirements for security breach notifications."
"Existing law establishes the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge a child to be a dependent of the court under certain circumstances, including when the child has been left without any provision for support or when a parent or guardian fails to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment. Existing law provides that the Legislature declares that a child whose parent has been adjudged a dependent child of the court shall not be considered at risk of abuse or neglect solely because of the age, dependent status, or foster care status of the parent.
This bill would additionally declare that a child whose parent has been adjudged a dependent child of the court shall not be considered at risk of abuse or neglect solely on the basis of information concerning the parent’s placement history, past behaviors, health or mental health diagnoses occurring prior to the pregnancy, except as specified.
Existing law provides that reunification services need not be provided to the family of a dependent child under certain circumstances.
This bill would enact certain exceptions to that provision that would apply in the case of a child for whom one or both minor parents have been adjudged to be dependent children of the juvenile court, thereby providing the family access to reunification services. The bill would also require, in those cases, a party seeking an involuntary foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights over, a child born to a parent or parents who were minors at the time of the child’s birth to demonstrate to the court that reasonable efforts were made to provide remedial services designed to prevent the removal of the child from the minor parent or parents, that these efforts have proved unsuccessful, and that those efforts utilize the available resources of the child and his or her minor parent or parents extended family, social services agencies, caregivers, and other available service providers. By imposing a higher level of service on county employees, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires the clerk of the superior court to open a separate court file for nonminor dependents under the dependency, delinquency, or transition jurisdiction of the court and limits access to those files.
This bill would require the clerk of the superior court to maintain court files and records concerning a minor dependent parent or a nonminor dependent parent separate from court files and records concerning his or her child, as specified. The bill would authorize dependency court records concerning a minor dependent parent or a nonminor dependent parent to be disclosed to the county and the court in the child’s dependency proceedings, but would require information from the records to only be admitted as evidence in the child’s dependency proceedings pursuant to a certain court order. The bill would authorize any party to the child’s dependency proceedings to request the admittance of the records concerning a minor dependent parent or a nonminor dependent parent as evidence at any stage of the child’s dependency proceedings.
Existing law declares the intent of the Legislature to maintain the continuity of the family unit and to support and preserve families headed by minor dependent parents and nonminor dependent parents. Existing law requires foster care placements for minor parents and their children to demonstrate a willingness and ability to provide support and assistance to minor parents and their children.
This bill would additionally require those foster care placements to support the preservation of the family unit and to refer a minor dependent parent or nonminor dependent parent to preventive services to address any concerns regarding the safety, health, or well-being of the child, and to help prevent, whenever possible, the filing of a petition to declare the child a dependent of the juvenile court.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code (the Code) to declare that a child of a minor parent or nonminor dependent parent shall not be considered to be at risk of abuse or neglect solely on the basis of the number of access to social services on minor parents or parents placement prior to the pregnancy, and that information from such records may be taken into account when considering whether other factors place the child at risk of abuse or neglect, although such information may be taken into account when considering whether other factors place the child at risk of abuse or neglect. Declares that in the case of a child for whom one or both minor parents have been adjudged to be dependent children of the juvenile court pursuant to Section 300 (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance), specified circumstances shall not apply, unless one or more of the following circumstances apply: (1) the Legislature declares that a child of a minor parent or nonminor dependent parent shall not be considered to be at risk of abuse or neglect solely on the basis of the number of access to social services on minor parents or parents placement prior to the pregnancy; and (2) reasonable efforts were made to provide remedial services designed to prevent removal of the child from the minor parent or parents, and such efforts have proved unsuccessful.

"(1) Existing law, the California Seed Law, requires the Secretary of Food and Agriculture, by regulation, to adopt, among other things, specified lists of plants and crops that the secretary finds are or may be grown in the state or that the secretary finds are detrimental to agriculture if they occur incidentally in other crops, as prescribed, a list of noxious weed seed that the secretary finds are prohibitive noxious weed seed, and methods and procedures, upon recommendation of the Seed Advisory Board, for the conciliation, mediation, or arbitration of disputes between labelers and any persons concerning conformance with label statements, advertisements, or other disputes regarding the quality or performance of seed.
This bill would expand this regulation authority to also make those methods and procedures for the conciliation, mediation, or arbitration of those disputes applicable to disputes concerning conformance with financial terms or the lack of payment by a dealer to a grower, as provided. By expanding the scope of that regulation authority, a violation of which is a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law specifies that every producer of any farm product that sells any farm product that is grown by him or her to any processor under contract, express or implied, in addition to all other rights and remedies that are provided by law, has a lien upon that product and upon all processed or manufactured forms of that farm product for his or her labor, care, and expense in growing and harvesting that product.
This bill would also specify that every producer of a flower, agricultural, or vegetable seed that sells seed that is grown by him or her, when the seed was purchased or supplied by the grower and not supplied by the dealer or an independent 3rd party who paid for the seed, to any seed dealer under contract, express or implied, in addition to all rights and remedies that are provided for by law, has a lien upon that product and upon all processed or manufactured forms of that product for his or her labor, care, and expense in growing and harvesting that product.
(3) Existing law requires that any person engaged in the business of buying, receiving on consignment, soliciting for sale on commission, or negotiating the sale of farm products from a licensee or producer for resale, to be licensed. Existing law, for purposes of those provisions, defines “farm product” to include every agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, and vegetable product of the soil, poultry and poultry products, livestock products and livestock not for immediate slaughter, bees and apiary products, hay, dried beans, honey, and cut flowers, but excludes from that definition any timber or timber product, flower or agricultural or vegetable seed not purchased from a producer, any milk product that is subject to specified licensing requirements, any aquacultural product, or cattle sold to any person who is bonded under a specified federal law.
This bill would revise that definition to exclude flower, agricultural, or vegetable seeds from the definition of farm products, rather than only those that have not been purchased from a producer.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Food and Agricultural Code to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to adopt as agricultural crops: (1) plants and crops that are or may be grown in California; (2) plants and crops that are detrimental to agriculture if they occur incidentally in other crops, which are classed as weed seed except if sold alone or as a specific constituent of a definite seed mixture; (3) noxious weed seed that are not classified as prohibited noxious weed seed and that are classified as restricted noxious weed seed; and (4) substances that are likely to be used for treating grain or other crop seed that the Secretary finds and determines are toxic to human beings or animals if used. Declares that methods and procedures for the conciliation, mediation, or arbitration of disputes between labelers and any persons concerning conformance with label statements, advertisements, financial terms, or the lack of payment by a dealer to a grower, or other disputes regarding the quality or performance of seed, shall be a mandatory prerequisite to pursuing other dispute resolution mechanisms, including litigation.

"Under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, it is unlawful to engage in specified discriminatory practices in employment or housing accommodations on the basis of certain specified characteristics, including race, creed, or national origin. Existing law defines these characteristics and other terms for purposes of the act.

This bill would make a person deputized or appointed by the proper authority as a peace officer pursuant to the above provisions an employee for purposes of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act.
The bill would also update an obsolete cross-reference.","Provides that the powers and duties of a peace officer shall include the full powers and duties of: (1) a reserve sheriff or city police officer, a reserve deputy sheriff, a reserve deputy marshal, a reserve police officer of a regional park district or of a transit district, a reserve park ranger, a reserve harbor or port police officer of a county, city, or district, a reserve officer of a police protection district formed under the Harbors and Navigation Code, a reserve deputy of the Department of Fish and Game, a reserve special agent of the Department of Justice, a reserve officer of a community service district which is authorized under specified law to maintain a police department or other police protection, a reserve officer of a school district police department under the Education Code, a reserve officer of a community college police department, a reserve officer of a police protection district formed under Part 1 of the Health and Safety Code, or a reserve housing authority patrol officer employed by a housing authority. Specifies that the authority of a reserve park ranger or a transit, harbor, or port district reserve officer may carry firearms only if authorized by, and under those terms and conditions as are specified by, his or her employing agency."
"(1) Existing law, the Carpenter-Presley-Tanner Hazardous Substance Account Act, imposes liability for hazardous substances removal or remedial actions and requires the Attorney General to recover from the liable person, as defined, certain costs incurred by the Department of Toxic Substances Control or a California regional water quality control board, upon the request of the department or regional board. The act authorizes, except as specified, a party found liable for any costs or expenditures recoverable under the act for those actions to establish, as specified, that only a portion of those costs or expenditures are attributable to the party, and requires the party to pay only for that portion. If each party does not establish its liability, the act requires a court to apportion those costs or expenditures, as specified, among the defendants and the remaining portion of the judgment is required to be paid from the Toxic Substances Control Account. Existing law authorizes the money deposited in the Toxic Substances Control Account in the General Fund to be appropriated to the Department of Toxic Substances Control for specified purposes, including the payment of the costs incurred by the state for those actions.
This bill would specifically apply those provisions to response and corrective actions, instead of to removal and remedial actions, and would delete the requirement that the remaining portion of a judgment for costs and expenditures that is not apportioned among the liable persons be paid from that account.
(2) The act requires an action brought pursuant to it for the recovery of the costs of a removal or remedial action, or for the recovery of specified administrative costs, to be commenced within 3 years after completion of the removal or remedial action has been certified by the department.
This bill would, except as provided, instead allow an action for the recovery of the costs of carrying out or overseeing a response or corrective action to be commenced either within that 3-year period or, if operation and maintenance is required as part of the response or corrective action, within 3 years after completion of operation and maintenance has been certified by the department or a regional board.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code, with respect to cost recovery actions, to allow a public agency or a person operating a household hazardous waste collection program, or for material received from the public as used oil, to not be held liable in such an action unless the person has paid all costs attributable to the action. A public agency or a person operating a household hazardous waste collection program or a person operating a certified used oil collection center shall not be liable in such an action unless the person has paid all costs attributable to the action."
"Existing law authorizes the legislative body of a city to submit to voters at any municipal or special election an ordinance providing for the election of members of the legislative body by districts, from districts, by districts with an elective mayor, or from districts with an elective mayor. Existing law also authorizes such an ordinance to be submitted to the voters by means of an initiative measure. Existing law requires that the ordinance state the number of legislative districts, describe the boundaries of each, number the districts, and state the method for electing the members of the legislative body, as described above.
This bill would delete the requirement that the ordinance describe the boundaries, and number, of each legislative district and would instead require the legislative body to prepare a proposed map describing the boundaries and numbers of the legislative districts after the ordinance is passed or enacted, as specified. The bill would require a legislative body changing from a from district method of election to a by district method of election, or adjusting the district boundaries, to hold public hearings on the change or adjustments, as specified. The bill would also make numerous technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.
Existing law applies certain procedures if a majority of votes on the subject of incorporating a new city are in favor of incorporation and in favor of a by district method of election, including, among other things, requiring the boundaries of the districts of the legislative body to be as nearly equal in population as possible.
This bill would also require the districts to comply with applicable provisions of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Existing law authorizes the legislative body of a city with a population of fewer than 100,000 people to adopt an ordinance that requires the members of the legislative body to be elected by district or by district with an elective mayor without submitting the ordinance for voter approval.
This bill would extend this authority to the legislative body of any city, regardless of its population.","Provides that the voters may express their choice on such ballots if a majority of the voters approve the proposed ordinance vote in its favor.

Provides that if, at the time a vote is held on the subject of incorporation of a new city, a majority of the votes cast on the question of whether members of the city council in future elections are to be elected by district or at large is in favor of election by district or resolution, all of the districts districts elected with the lowest vote shall expire on the first day of regular election and all members elected at the succeeding district boundaries shall hold office for the next four-year period. Requires the districts to comply with applicable provisions of the Federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 as amended by this Act."
"Existing law authorizes, until January 1, 2019, a city that has entered into a reciprocal agreement, as defined, with the Franchise Tax Board to exchange tax information, as provided. Existing law requires, until January 1, 2019, upon the request of the Franchise Tax Board, each city that assesses a city business tax or requires a city business license to annually submit to the board specified information relating to the administration of the city’s business tax program. Existing law defines the term “city” to include, among others, a city and county. Existing law limits the collection and use of this information and provides that any unauthorized use of this information is punishable as a misdemeanor.
This bill would expand these provisions to additionally apply to a county. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

"Existing law establishes a small claims division, known as a small claims court, in each superior court. Existing law provides that the small claims court has jurisdiction over actions seeking certain forms of relief, including money damages in specified amounts. Existing law prohibits a city, county, city and county, school district, county office of education, community college district, local district, or any other local public entity from filing a claim in the small claims division if the amount of the demand exceeds $5,000. Existing law also provides that a small claims action filed by a city, county, city and county, school district, county office of education, community college district, local district, or any other local public entity must be transferred out of the small claims division if the opposing party is represented by legal counsel and properly informs the entity of this fact.
This bill would give the small claims court jurisdiction over an action filed by a city, county, city and county, school district, county office of education, community college district, local district, or any other local public entity if the amount of the demand does not exceed $10,000. This bill would also eliminate the provision relating to the transfer of small claims actions where the opposing party is represented by counsel.","Amends the Code of Civil Procedure to grant the small claims court jurisdiction in specified amounts for: (1) recovery of money for a plaintiff who has filed a small claims action, if the amount of the demand does not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); (2) enforcement of payment of unsecured personal property taxes, if the legality of the tax is not contested by the defendant; (3) issuance of the writ of possession, if the amount of the demand does not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); (4) confirmation, correct, or vacate of a fee arbitration award between an attorney and client that is binding or has become binding; and (5) equitable relief against a defendant in certain cases where the plaintiff has alleged in the complaint that he or she has exhausted administrative remedies.

This bill would require that the employee do that work for the same employer in order to qualify for accrued sick leave under these provisions. This bill would exclude a retired annuitant of a public entity, as specified, from the definition of employee under these provisions.
The bill would authorize an employer to provide for employee sick leave accrual on a basis other than one hour for each 30 hours worked, provided that the accrual is on a regular basis and the employee will have 24 hours of accrued sick leave available by the 120th calendar day of employment.
(2) Existing law entitles an employee to use accrued paid sick days beginning on the 90th day of employment. Existing law permits an employer to limit an employee’s use of paid sick days to 24 hours or 3 days in each year of employment.

This bill would authorize an employer to limit an employee’s use of paid sick days to 24 hours or 3 days in each year of employment, a calendar year, or a 12-month period. This bill would, for specified industries, delay the application of the notice requirement. The bill would permit an employer who provides unlimited sick leave to its employees to satisfy notice requirements by indicating “unlimited” on the employee’s itemized wage statement. The bill would require an employer to calculate paid sick leave based upon an employee’s regular rate of pay, total wages divided by total hours worked in a 90-day period, or the wages for other forms of paid leave, as specified. The bill would provide that an employer is not required to reinstate accrued paid time off to an employee, rehired within one year of separation from employment, that was paid out at the time of termination, resignation, or separation. The bill would provide that an employer is not required to provide additional paid sick days if the employer has a paid leave policy or paid time off policy, the employer makes available an amount of leave applicable to employees for specified uses, and the policy satisfies specified accrual, carry over, and use requirements, or that provided paid sick leave or paid time off to employees before January 1, 2015, as specified, or that are provided pursuant to specified provisions of law or of a memorandum understanding that meet the requirements of these provisions.

CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment. CEQA establishes a procedure by which a person may seek judicial review of the decision of the lead agency made pursuant to CEQA and a procedure for the preparation and certification of the record of proceedings upon the filing of an action or proceeding challenging a lead agency’s action on the grounds of noncompliance with CEQA.

This bill would require the public agency, in certifying the environmental impact report and in granting approvals for specified water storage projects funded, in whole or in part, by Proposition 1, to comply with specified procedures. Because a public agency would be required to comply with those new procedures, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize the public agency to concurrently prepare the record of proceedings for the project. The bill would require the Judicial Council, on or before July 1, 2016, to adopt a rule of court to establish procedures applicable to actions or proceedings seeking judicial review of a public agency’s action in certifying the environmental impact report and in granting project approval for those projects that require the actions or proceedings, including any appeals therefrom, be resolved, to the extent feasible, within
270
370
days of the certification of the record of proceedings. The bill would prohibit a court from staying or enjoining those projects unless it makes specified findings.

The bill would require an agency, department, or officer that calls a veterinarian pursuant to these provisions to notify the board of the investigation. The bill would also authorize a veterinarian who is called from another state to care for animals that are affected by an investigation with a temporary shelter facility established only for the purpose of the investigation, which would be exempt from specified registration requirements if it meets specified conditions.","Exempts from the licensing requirements of this Act a regularly licensed veterinarian in good standing who is called from another state to attend cases within a single geographic location as part of an investigation by a law enforcement agency or animal control agency of an alleged violation of federal or state animal fighting or animal cruelty laws.

Existing law establishes the California Partnership for Long-Term Care Program to link private long-term care insurance and health care service plan contracts that cover long-term care with the In-Home Supportive Services program and Medi-Cal and to provide Medi-Cal benefits to certain individuals who have income and resources above the eligibility levels for receipt of medical assistance, but who have purchased certified private long-term care insurance policies.
This bill would establish the Long Term Care Insurance Task Force in the Department of Insurance, chaired by the Insurance Commissioner or his or her designee, and composed of specified stakeholders and representatives of government agencies to examine the components necessary to design and implement a statewide long-term care insurance program, as specified. The bill would require the task force to recommend options for establishing this program and to comment on their respective degrees of feasibility in a report submitted to the commissioner, the Governor, and the Legislature by July 1, 2017. The bill would require the department to produce, no later than July 1, 2018, an actuarial report of those recommendations, to be shared with and approved by the task force. If approved, the bill would require the report to be submitted to the Legislature, as specified.",This bill establishes a task force to explore the feasibility of developing and implementing a culturally competent statewide insurance program for long-term care services and supports. The task force must examine: (1) the components necessary to design and implement a statewide long-term care insurance program; and (2) options for the design of the program.
"(1) Existing law authorizes the State Air Resources Board and air pollution control and air quality management districts to enforce air quality laws.
This bill would require the State Air Resources Board and air pollution control and air quality management districts to adopt regulations classifying minor violations. The bill would define the term “notice to comply” and would require a representative of those agencies, who in the course of conducting an inspection detects a minor violation, to issue a notice to comply, as specified.
The bill would exempt an air pollution control or air quality management district from these provisions if it has in effect, as of January 1, 2015, a program with similar provisions, as specified.
The bill would require the State Air Resources Board to report to the Legislature by January 1, 2020, regarding implementation of the bill.
Because the bill would make a false statement of compliance submitted under those procedures a crime pursuant to specified provisions, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime. In addition, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by imposing new requirements on air pollution control and air quality management districts.
(2)The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Provides that the Legislature finds and declares that the purpose of this Act is to establish an enforcement policy for violations of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code that the enforcement agency finds are minor when the danger they pose to, or the potential that they have for endangering, human health, safety, or welfare or the environment is taken into account. Declares that it is the intent of the Legislature to provide a more resource-efficient enforcement mechanism, faster compliance times, and the creation of a productive and cooperative working relationship between the State board, the districts, and the regulated community while maintaining protection of human health and safety health, safety, and welfare and the environment. Requires the State board and each district to implement this Act by adopting a regulation or rule that classifies the types of violations of Division 26 that the board or district finds are minor violations in accordance with this Act. Provides that, in classifying the types of violations that are minor, the state board or district shall consider all of the following factors: the magnitude of the violation; the scope of the violation; the severity of the violation; the degree to which a violation puts human health, safety, or welfare or the environment into jeopardy; the degree to which a violation could contribute to the failure to accomplish an important goal"
"Existing law authorizes the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to impose, in addition to any other tax that it is authorized to impose, a transactions and use tax at a rate of 0.5% for the funding of specified transportation-related projects and programs, subject to various requirements, including the adoption of an expenditure plan and voter approval. Existing law authorizes the MTA to seek voter approval to extend the transactions and use tax pursuant to an amended ordinance, subject to various requirements, including adoption of an amended expenditure plan that, among other things, updates certain cost estimates and identifies expected completion dates for projects and programs under the previous expenditure plan, and also requires the amended expenditure plan to be included in an updated long range transportation plan, as specified.
This bill would authorize the MTA to impose an additional transportation transactions and use tax at a rate of 0.5%, for a period not to exceed 30 years, subject to various requirements, including the adoption of an expenditure plan and voter approval.
The Transactions and Use Tax Law limits to 2% the combined rate of all transactions and use taxes imposed in any county, with certain exceptions.
This bill would exempt the transactions and use tax authorized by the bill from this limitation.","Amends the Public Utilities Code to authorize the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to impose a transaction and use tax at the rate of 1.5%, for a period not to exceed 30 years, at the rate of 1.5% in the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County. Requires theMTA Board of Directors to adopt an expenditure plan that lists transportation projects and programs to be funded from net revenues from the tax, including measures to ensure net revenues are shared equitably between regions of the county."
"Existing law provides for political subdivisions that encompass areas of representation within the state. With respect to these areas, public officials are generally elected by all of the voters of the political subdivision (at-large) or by districts formed within the political subdivision (district-based). Existing law requires a political subdivision, as defined, that changes from an at-large method of election to a district-based election to hold at least 2 public hearings on a proposal to establish the district boundaries of the political subdivision before a public hearing at which the governing body of the political subdivision votes to approve or defeat the proposal.
This bill would instead require a political subdivision that changes to, or establishes, district-based elections to hold public hearings before and after drawing a preliminary map or maps of the proposed district boundaries, as specified.
Existing law, the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (CVRA), prohibits the use of an at-large method of election in a political subdivision if it would impair the ability of a protected class, as defined, to elect candidates of its choice or otherwise influence the outcome of an election. The CVRA provides that a voter who is a member of a protected class may bring an action in superior court to enforce its provisions.
This bill would require a prospective plaintiff under the CVRA to first send a written notice to the political subdivision against which the action would be brought indicating that the method of election used by the political subdivision may violate the CVRA. The bill would permit the political subdivision to take ameliorative steps to correct the alleged violation before the prospective plaintiff commences litigation, and it would stay the prospective plaintiff’s ability to file suit for a prescribed amount of time. This bill would also permit a prospective plaintiff who sent a written notice, as described, to recover from the political subdivision reasonable costs incurred in supporting the written notice.
Because the bill would impose additional duties on local agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the California Election Code to require a political subdivision that changes from an at-large method of election to a district-based election or that establishes district-based elections to: (1) hold at least two public hearings before a public hearing at which the governing body votes to approve or defeat an ordinance establishing district-based elections; (2) publish and make available for release at least one draft map and, if members of the governing body will be elected in their districts at different times to provide for staggered terms of office, the potential sequence of the elections; and (3) hold at least two additional hearings over a period of no more than 45 days, at which the public is invited to provide input regarding the content of the draft map or maps and the proposed sequence of elections. Requires the governing body, in determining the final sequence of the district elections conducted in a political subdivision in which members of the governing body will be elected at different times to provide for staggered terms of office, to give special consideration to the purposes of the California Voting Rights Act of 2001."
"Existing law prohibits the taking or possession of any fully protected fish, except as provided, and designates the unarmored threespine stickleback as a fully protected fish. The California Endangered Species Act prohibits the taking of an endangered or threatened species, except as specified. The Department of Fish and Wildlife may authorize the take of listed species if the take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and the impacts are minimized and fully mitigated.
This bill would permit the department to authorize, under the California Endangered Species Act, the take of the unarmored threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus williamsoni) resulting from impacts attributable to the habitat restoration project to restore, maintain, and improve riparian habitat on public lands in a prescribed portion of Bouquet Creek and projects to restore the flow capacity to Bouquet Creek in Bouquet Canyon on public lands, as specified, if certain conditions are satisfied.
This bill would incorporate additional changes in Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code, proposed by AB 1527, to be operative only if AB 1527 and this bill are chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 14, 2003.

"Existing law, the Unclaimed Property Law, governs the disposition of unclaimed property, including the escheat of certain property to the state. Existing law provides for the escheat to the state of the contents of, or proceeds of sale of the contents of, any safe deposit box or any other safekeeping repository held in the state by a business association, as specified. In cases where the contents of a safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository escheat to the state, existing law requires the business association to report to the Controller certain information regarding the property and owner, including a description of the property and the place where it is held and may be inspected by the Controller. Within 165 days after the final date for filing the report, existing law requires the Controller to mail a notice to each person having an address listed in the report who appears to be entitled to property escheated, as specified.
This bill would additionally authorize the Controller to mail a separate notice to an apparent owner of a United States savings bond, war bond, or military award inside a safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository whose name is shown on or can be associated with the contents of a safe deposit box or other safekeeping repository and is different from the name of the reported owner.","(Sec. 1) Allows the Controller of the State of California, in addition to the notices required under current law to notify an apparent owner of a United States savings bond, war bond, or military award whose name is shown on or can be associated with the contents of a safe deposit box or other repository and is different from the reported owner, to mail a separate notice to an apparent owner whose name is shown on or can be associated with the contents of such a repository and is different from the reported owner. Declares that such a notice shall not contain a photograph or likeness of an elected official. Declares that: (1) upon request of the Controller, a State or local governmental agency may furnish to the Controller from its records identification or location information that could reasonably be used to locate an owner of unclaimed property; and (2) if the address or other identification or location information requested is deemed confidential under any law or regulation of the State, it shall nevertheless be furnished to the Controller.

"Existing law regulates various aspects of the workplace and employee safety and health.
This bill, upon a change in control of a grocery establishment, would require an incumbent grocery employer to prepare a list of specified eligible grocery workers for a successor grocery employer, and would require the successor grocery employer to hire from this list during a 90-day transition period. The bill would require the successor grocery employer to retain eligible grocery workers for a 90-day period, prohibit the successor grocery employer from discharging those workers without cause during that period, and, upon the close of that period, require the successor grocery employer to consider offering continued employment to those workers. The bill would exempt a grocery establishment located in a food desert from the bill’s requirements, as provided. The bill would provide that a collective bargaining agreement may supersede these requirements and that these provisions do not preempt any local ordinances that provide equal or greater protection to eligible grocery workers.
This bill would provide that its provisions are severable.","Amends the Labor Code to establish a transitional retention period for grocery retail workers upon change of ownership, control, or operation of grocery stores. Declares that a transitional retention period for such workers ensures stability throughout California for these workers, which, in turn, results in preservation of health and safety standards.

"Existing law, the California Emergency Services Act, authorizes local government entities to create disaster councils by ordinance and in turn develop disaster plans specific to their jurisdictions. Existing law, the Radiation Protection Act of 1999, requires local governments to develop and maintain radiological emergency preparedness and response plans to safeguard the public in the emergency planning zone around a nuclear powerplant, and generally makes the Office of Emergency Services responsible for the coordination and integration of all emergency planning programs and response plans created pursuant to the Radiation Protection Act of 1999. The California Emergency Services Act, until July 1, 2019, prescribes a method for funding state and local costs for carrying out these activities that are not reimbursed by federal funds, with the costs borne by utilities operating nuclear powerplants with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts or more.
This bill, operative July 1, 2019, would extend, until August 26, 2025, the method for funding state and local costs for emergency service activities associated with a nuclear powerplant, as described above, with respect to a utility operating a nuclear powerplant with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts or more, thereby extending an amount, as specified, available for disbursement for local costs for the Diablo Canyon site.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility, and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. Existing law requires the commission, for purposes of establishing rates for any electrical corporation, to disallow expenses reflecting the direct or indirect costs resulting from any unreasonable error or omission relating to the planning, construction, or operation of any portion of the corporation’s plant which cost, or is estimated to have cost, more than $50,000,000, including any expenses resulting from delays caused by any unreasonable error or omission. For these purposes, “planning” includes activities related to the initial and subsequent assessments of the need for a plant construction project and includes investigation and interpretation of environmental factors such as seismic conditions.
This bill would require the commission to convene, or continue, until August 26, 2025, an independent peer review panel to conduct an independent review of enhanced seismic studies and surveys of the Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 powerplant, including the surrounding areas of the facility and areas of nuclear waste storage.

Requires the Public Utilities Commission to develop and transmit to the Office of Emergency Services of the Department of Health and Human Services an equitable method of assessing a utility operating a powerplant for its reasonable share of state and local agency costs. Requires a utility, upon notification by the office, to pay this amount to the Controller for deposit in the Nuclear Planning Assessment Special Account, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to carry out activities pursuant to this Act and Chapter 4 of the Health and Safety Code that are not reimbursed by federal funds. Requires the Controller to pay from this account the state and local costs relative to carrying out this Act and Chapter 4. Authorizes the Controller to disburse up to 80% of a fiscal year allocation from the Special Account, in advance, for anticipated local expenses."
"Existing law relating to redevelopment agencies provides for specified payments with respect to development project areas.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Act of California to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make annual payments from the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund to affected taxing entities for the use of tax increment funds for educational facilities. The payments are allocated among the affected taxing entities, including the community, if the community elects to receive payments in proportion to the percentage share of property taxes each affected taxing entity receives during the fiscal year. The bill requires HHS to reduce its payments to an affected taxing entity by any amount it has paid pursuant to specified provisions of law for, or in connection with, a public facility owned or leased by that affected taxing agency, except: (1) any amounts the agency has paid directly or indirectly pursuant to an agreement with a taxing entity adopted prior to January 1, 1994; or (2) any amounts that are unrelated to the specific project area or amendment governed by this bill.

"Existing law requires each county to provide cash assistance and other social services to needy families through the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program using federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant program, state, and county funds. Under existing law, all applicants for or recipients of CalWORKs are required to ensure and provide documentation that each child in the assistance unit who is not required to be enrolled in school has received all age-appropriate immunizations, unless it has been medically determined that an immunization for the child is not appropriate or the applicant or recipient has filed with the county welfare department an affidavit that the immunizations are contrary to the applicant’s or recipient’s beliefs.
This bill would, commencing July 1, 2016, instead require the applicant or recipient to ensure that each child in the assistance unit who is not required to be enrolled in school has received all age-appropriate immunizations. The bill would also authorize the county to review the California Immunization Registry in lieu of initially requesting verification of an immunization before requiring the applicant or recipient to provide documentation that the immunization has been performed.
Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2016.

If a child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parents, existing law requires preferential consideration to be given to a request by a relative of the child for placement of the child with the relative. Existing law requires that the best interest of the child be considered, among other specified factors, in making that determination.
Existing law also requires that, subsequent to the hearing on the proper disposition to be made of the child, whenever a new placement of the child must be made, consideration for placement again be given to relatives who have not been found to be unsuitable, as specified.
This bill would
state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to ensure the best possible outcome for children removed from the physical custody of his or her parents.
require the county social worker and the court, when determining whether placement with a relative is appropriate, to consider the above-described factors on a case-by-case basis. The bill also would require that consideration for placement with a relative subsequent to the disposition hearing be given without regard to whether a new placement of a child must be made, and would direct the social worker to report and the court to consider additional enumerated factors in making this determination. By increasing the duties of county social workers, this bill would create a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require the Judicial Council to adopt a rule of court on or before January 1, 2017, that implements these provisions.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to provide that, in any case in which a child is removed from the physical custody of his or her parents pursuant to preferential consideration, the desire by a relative of the child for placement of the child with the relative, regardless of the relative's immigration status, shall be given to a request by a relative of the child for placement of the child with the relative, regardless of the relative's immigration status.

"(1) Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation by the State Department of Public Health of health facilities, including general acute care hospitals. A violation of these provisions is a crime. Existing law requires those hospitals to adopt and review annually a policy for providing language assistance services to patients with language or communication barriers, as defined. Existing law requires a hospital to annually transmit to the department a copy of its updated policy and to include a description of its efforts to ensure adequate and speedy communication between patients with language or communication barriers and staff.
This bill would require a general acute care hospital and the department to make the hospital’s updated policy available annually to the public on their respective Internet Web sites. The bill would also require a general acute care hospital to post on its Internet Web site a notice, in English and in the other most commonly spoken languages in the hospital’s service area, of the availability of language assistance services. Because a violation of these provisions by a health facility would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

Provides that a hospital is not required to make notice available in more than five languages other than English."
"Existing law, as amended by the DNA Act, requires a person who has been convicted of a felony offense to provide buccal swab samples, right thumbprints, and a full palm print impression of each hand, and any blood specimens or other biological samples required for law enforcement identification analysis. Existing law makes these provisions retroactive, regardless of when the crime charged or committed became a qualifying offense.
This bill would expand these provisions to require persons convicted of specified
misdemeanors, if they have a prior conviction of other specified misdemeanors,
misdemeanors
to provide buccal swab samples, right thumbprints, and a full palm print impression of each hand, and any blood specimens or other biological samples required for law enforcement identification analysis. By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement agencies to collect and forward these samples, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law prohibits a judge from relieving a person of the separate administrative duty to provide specimens, samples, or print impressions required by the DNA Act if the person has been found guilty of an offense for which DNA collection is required. Existing law, added by Proposition 47, allows a person to petition the court for resentencing if he or she was convicted of a felony that was reduced to a misdemeanor by Proposition 47. Existing law requires the court to resentence the petitioner, unless the court determines that the person would pose an unreasonable risk to public safety.
This bill would clarify that the prohibition on judges relieving a person of the duty to provide specimens, samples, or print impressions is not affected by resentencing under Proposition 47.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

"Existing law establishes conditional voter registration, using an affidavit of registration, whereby a person is permitted to register to vote after the 15th day before an election or on election day, and cast a provisional ballot to be counted if the conditional voter registration is deemed effective. Existing law establishes the procedures and requirements for determining whether a conditional voter registration is deemed effective, requires the county elections official to offer conditional voter registration and provisional voting at its permanent offices, and authorizes the official to offer this registration and voting at satellite offices on election day.
This bill would require that a registrant provide proof of residence, as specified, in order for a conditional voter registration to be deemed effective. If a conditional voter registration is not deemed effective, the bill would require the elections official to process the affidavit of registration, as specified, and if all other eligibility requirements are met, would require the registration to be effective in forthcoming elections. By imposing additional duties on county election officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

"The Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000 governs the procedures for the formation and change of organization of cities and special districts. Existing law permits a city or district to provide extended services, as defined, outside its jurisdictional boundaries only if it first requests and receives written approval from the local agency formation commission in the affected county. Under existing law, the commission may authorize a city or district to provide new or extended services outside both its jurisdictional boundaries and its sphere of influence under specified circumstances, including when responding to an impending threat to the public health or safety of the residents in the affected territory where specified requirements are met.
This bill would revise the circumstances under which the commission may authorize a city or district to provide new or extended services. This bill would additionally establish a pilot program, until January 1, 2021, for the Napa and San Bernardino commissions that would permit those commissions to authorize a city or district to provide new or extended services outside both its jurisdictional boundaries and its sphere of influence under specified circumstances.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Napa and San Bernardino commissions.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 56133 of the Government Code proposed by SB 239 that would become operative if this bill and SB 239 are both enacted and this bill is enacted last.","Provides that a city or district may provide new or extended services by contract or agreement outside its jurisdictional boundary only if it first requests and receives written approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Authorizes FERC to authorize a city or district to provide new or extended services outside its jurisdictional boundary but within its sphere of influence in anticipation of a later change of organization if: (1) the entity applying for approval has provided FERC with documentation of a threat to the health and safety of the public or the affected residents; and (2) FERC has notified any alternate service provider, including any water corporation, that has filed a map and a statement of its service capabilities with FERC. Requires the executive officer, within 30 days of receipt of a request for approval by a city or district to extend services outside its jurisdictional boundary, to determine whether the request is complete and acceptable for filing or whether it is incomplete."
"(1) Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law imposes numerous duties on the board of governors with respect to these administrative responsibilities, including a requirement to review the accreditation status of community colleges in certain circumstances.
This bill would add to the duties of the board of governors by requiring it to conduct a survey of the community colleges, including consultation with representatives of both faculty and classified personnel, to develop a report to be transmitted to the United States Department of Education and the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity that reflects a systemwide evaluation of the regional accrediting agency based on the criteria used to determine an accreditor’s status.
(2) Existing law requires the accrediting agency for the community colleges to report to the appropriate policy and budget subcommittees of the Legislature upon the issuance of a decision that affects the accreditation status of a community college and, on a biannual basis, to report any accreditation policy changes that affect the accreditation process or status for a community college.
This bill would require the regional accrediting agency for the community colleges to report to the board of governors as soon as practicable after the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity has notified the regional accrediting agency of the date by which the agency’s application for continued recognition is due.","Requires the board of governors of the California Community Colleges to provide general supervision over community college districts and to establish specified minimum standards relating to student academic standards, employment of academic and administrative staff, formation of community colleges and districts, and standards governing procedures for faculty, staff, and students.Directs the board to: (1) evaluate the fiscal and educational effectiveness of community college districts according to outcome measures cooperatively developed with those districts; (2) conduct necessary system-wide research on community colleges; (3) provide representation, advocacy, and accountability for the California Community Colleges before State and national legislative and executive agencies; (4) conduct a survey of the community colleges in order to develop a report to be transmitted to the United States Department of Education and the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity that reflects a system-wide evaluation of the regional accrediting agency; (5) coordinate State support programs, both operational and capital outlay, and those federally supported programs for which the board of governors has responsibility pursuant to State or Federal law; (6) prepare and adopt a proposed budget for the California Community Colleges; (7) review and approve comprehensive plans for each community college district; (8) establish space and utilization standards for facility planning in order to determine eligibility for State funds for construction purposes; (9) review and approve all educational programs offered by community college districts"
"Existing law makes certain findings and declarations relating to the education of hard-of-hearing and deaf pupils.
This bill would revise those findings and declarations to include nonverbal pupils.
Existing law requires the adopted course of study for grades 1 to 6, inclusive, to include certain areas of study, including, among others, English, mathematics, social sciences, science, and physical education, as specified. Existing law requires that physical education have a total period of time of not less than 200 minutes each 10 schooldays, as provided.
This bill would authorize a complaint that a school district or county superintendent of schools has not complied with the physical education requirements of the adopted course of study for grades 1 to 6, inclusive, to be filed with the school district or county superintendent of schools pursuant to the local complaint procedures, if any, or the Uniform Complaint Procedures, as specified. The bill would authorize a complainant not satisfied with the school district’s or county superintendent of schools decision to file an appeal with the Superintendent of Public Instruction. If a school district or county superintendent of schools finds merit in the complaint, or the Superintendent finds merit in the appeal, the bill would require the school district or county superintendent of schools to provide a remedy, as provided. To the extent this bill would impose additional duties on school districts or county education officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would prohibit specified civil actions against a school district or county superintendent of schools relating to noncompliance with the physical education requirements unless the complainant first follows local complaint procedures, if any, or the Uniform Complaint Procedures, if no local complaint procedures exist.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)Amends the California Education Code to provide that it is essential that hard-of-hearing and deaf hard-of-hearing children have an education in which they are exposed to the unique nature of their nature, and that they have programs designed to fit their role in the development of human relations, including the role of deaf and deaf hard-of-hearing persons in the American economic system.Directs that such children's educational opportunities include: (1) inclusive, beginning in grade one and continuing through grade six, in specified areas of study, science, economics, history, sociology, and psychology; (2) educational programs in which their unique communication mode is respected, utilized, and developed to an appropriate level of proficiency; (3) appropriate training for special education teachers, speech therapists, administrators, and other special education personnel; (4) appropriate education in which their parents are involved, where appropriate, in determining the extent to which deaf and deaf hard-of-hearing children have an education in which their parents and other persons are involved in the development of American economic system, including the role of deaf and deaf hard-of-hearing persons in such system;"

Existing law, under the program, authorizes a child or spouse to continue to operate a disabled veteran business enterprise for 3 years after the death or the certification of a permanent medical disability of a disabled veteran who was the majority owner of that enterprise, but only for purposes of any contract entered into before his or her death or certification of disability.
This bill would delete the provision that only allows a child or spouse to operate the business for purposes of the contracts entered into before death or certification of disability. The bill would clarify the scope and purpose of the provision authorizing a child or spouse to continue to operate a disabled veteran business enterprise for 3 years after the death or the certification of a permanent medical disability of a disabled veteran who was the majority owner of that enterprise. The bill would also set forth a statement of legislative intent.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 19, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) States that the intent of the California Legislature is that the certification created by this Act not conflict with the intended purpose of the California Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise Program to address the special needs of disabled veterans seeking rehabilitation and training through entrepreneurship and to recognize the sacrifices of Californians disabled during military service.

Existing law authorizes the use of a tenant’s security deposit to compensate a landlord for a tenant’s default in the payment of rent. Existing law provides that existing law governing security deposits applies to these terminations.
This bill would extend these provisions indefinitely and would reduce the time limit for a tenant to give a notice of intent to vacate to the landlord under these provisions from 30 days to 14 days.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 8, 2014.

"Existing law requires the Judicial Council to establish a Court-Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) program, under which volunteers serve as court appointed child advocates to provide designated services and support to dependent children and nonminor dependents in juvenile dependency proceedings. Existing law provides that a minor, under certain circumstances, is subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. If the minor has violated a law or ordinance, existing law authorizes the juvenile court to adjudge the minor to be a ward of the court.
This bill would authorize the appointment of a CASA in a juvenile delinquency proceeding, and would provide that a CASA shall be considered court personnel for purposes of inspecting the case file of a dependent child or ward of the juvenile court.","This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to provide for a Court-Appointed Special Advocate program in California.

This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code, with respect to the required electronic benefits transfer system, to require that such system be designed: (1) to allow recipients to gain access to their benefits by using every other electronic benefits transfer system; (2) to be compatible with electronic benefits transfer systems in other states; (3) to ensure that recipients have access to electronically issued benefits through systems such as automated teller machines, point-of-sale devices, or other devices that accept electronic benefits transfer transactions; (4) to provide reasonable access for recipients who demonstrate an inability to use an electronic benefits transfer card or other aspect of the system because of disability, language, lack of access, or other barrier; (5) to permit a recipient to choose a personal identification number (PIN) to assist the recipient to remember his or her number; (6) to have a 24-hour per day toll-free telephone hotline for the reporting of lost or stolen cards that will provide recipients with information on how to have such cards replaced and that will allow an authorized representative or head of household to access, over the telephone, the transaction history detail for at least the last ten transactions; and (7) to have an Internet website that will provide recipients with information on how to have such cards replaced and that will allow an authorized representative or head of household to"
"Existing law provides for the State Supplementary Program for the Aged, Blind and Disabled (SSP), which requires the State Department of Social Services to contract with the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services to make payments to SSP recipients to supplement Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments made available pursuant to the federal Social Security Act.
Under existing law, benefit payments under the SSP are calculated by establishing the maximum level of nonexempt income and federal SSI and state SSP benefits for each category of eligible recipient. The state SSP payment is the amount, when added to the nonexempt income and SSI benefits available to the recipient, which would be required to provide the maximum benefit payment.
This bill, for the 2015–16 fiscal year, and annually thereafter, would require the state maximum SSP grant for individuals to be readjusted and increased so that the state SSP payment and federal SSI payment, when combined, equal 112% of the federal poverty level. By increasing the amount of SSP payments, which are expended from a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation.
Existing law prohibits a licensee of a long-term health care facility from discriminating or retaliating in any manner against a complainant, or a patient or employee in its facility, based on the presentation of a grievance or complaint or activities related to a specified investigation or proceeding at the facility. Existing law makes the willful violation of these provisions punishable as a crime.
This bill would expand the antiretaliation protections to apply to all health care workers of a long-term health care facility. The bill would increase the civil penalties and criminal penalties that apply to licensees who violate the provisions. The bill would also specify that a complainant who has been discriminated against may recover attorney’s fees and other legal costs.
Because this bill would expand the scope of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 1, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Welfare Institutions Act of 1965 to require a person who is an employee of, or a member of the medical staff of, a long-term health care facility to file a grievance with the Office of Long-Term Health Care Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or another entity that is responsible for accrediting or evaluating the facility's medical staff. The grievance must include, among other things, a statement that the employee, member, or medical staff: (1) has been discriminated against in employment because that person is an employee of, or a member of the medical staff of, the facility; or (2) has been retaliated against in employment because that person is an employee of, or a member of the medical staff of, the facility. A licensee is prohibited from discriminating or discriminating against an employee or member of medical staff on the basis that such person has done either of the following: (1) complaint or report to an accrediting entity or to any other governmental entity, or (2) cooperate in an investigation or administrative proceeding related to the quality care services of the facility that is carried out by an entity or agency responsible for accrediting or evaluating"
"Existing property tax law provides, pursuant to the authority of a specified provision of the California Constitution, for a homeowners’ exemption in the amount of $7,000 of the full value of a “dwelling,” as defined, and authorizes the Legislature to increase this exemption.
This bill, beginning with the lien date for the 2016–17 fiscal year, would increase the homeowners’ exemption from $7,000 to $25,000 of the full value of a dwelling. This bill would also require, for the 2017–18 fiscal year and for each fiscal year thereafter, the county assessor to adjust the amount of the homeowners’ exemption by the percentage change in the House Price Index for California for the first 3 quarters of the prior calendar year, as specified.
The California Constitution requires the Legislature, whenever it increases the homeowners’ property tax exemption, to provide a comparable increase in benefits to qualified renters. The Personal Income Tax Law authorizes various credits against the taxes imposed by that law, including a credit for qualified renters in the amount of $120 for married couples filing joint returns, heads of household, and surviving spouses if adjusted gross income is $50,000 or less, and in the amount of $60 for other individuals if adjusted gross income is $25,000 or less. Existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to annually adjust for inflation these adjusted gross income amounts.
This bill would, for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016, increase this credit for a qualified renter to $428 for married couples filing joint returns, heads of household, and surviving spouses if adjusted gross income is $50,000 or less, as adjusted for inflation, and to an amount equal to $214 for other individuals if adjusted gross income is $25,000 or less, as adjusted for inflation. The bill would also require, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, the Franchise Tax Board to annually adjust for inflation, based upon the California Consumer Price Index, the amount of these credits. The bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes to the renters’ credit.
Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.
The California Constitution requires the Legislature, in each fiscal year, to reimburse local governments for the revenue losses incurred by those governments in that fiscal year as a result of the homeowners’ property tax exemption.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","This bill amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to allow a general business tax exemption for the purchase of a single-family dwelling located in a disaster-designated area of California. The exemption applies to the value of the dwelling through FY2015, and for the first three quarters of the prior calendar year. The exemption does not extend to property that is rented, vacant, or that is a vacation or secondary home of the owner or owners. The bill allows a cooperative housing tax credit for the purchase of a dwelling located in a disaster-designated area. The credit applies to: (1) owners of a single-family dwelling, and (2) owners of a condominium abode occupied by an owner."
"Existing law allows an individual taxpayer to contribute amounts in excess of his or her personal income tax liability for the support of specified funds.
This bill would allow an individual to designate on his or her tax return that a specified amount in excess of his or her tax liability be transferred to the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund, which would be created by this bill. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to revise the tax return form to include a space for the designation of contributions to the fund when another voluntary designation is removed from the form or there is space, whichever occurs first.
This bill would require money contributed to the fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller for reimbursement of costs, as provided, and to the Department of Food and Agriculture for the development of a mechanism to provide ongoing public awareness through activities that will promote the charitable tax deduction for the fund and seek continued contributions and the distribution of grants on a competitive basis to, among others, a city, county, or city and county animal control agency or shelter, as specified, for the purpose of supporting spay and neuter activities by that entity to prevent and eliminate cat and dog homelessness.
The bill would provide that these provisions would remain in effect only until January 1 of the 5th taxable year following the first appearance of the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund on the tax return, or January 1, 2022, whichever occurs first, but would further provide for an earlier repeal if the Franchise Tax Board determines that the amount of contributions estimated to be received during a calendar year will not at least equal the minimum contribution amount, as defined, for that calendar year, in which case these provisions would be repealed on December 1 of that year.","Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to establish in the State of California the Prevention Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund, which shall receive contributions designated on tax returns to prevent and eliminate cat and dog homelessness and animal cruelty and neglect."
"Existing law provides that, one year prior to the minimum eligible parole release date of an inmate serving an indeterminate sentence, a panel of 2 or more commissioners or deputy commissioners of the Board of Parole Hearings shall meet with the inmate and set a parole release date, as specified. Existing law, as amended by Proposition 9, the Victim’s Bill of Rights Act of 2008: Marsy’s Law, at the November 4, 2008, statewide general election, establishes procedures at all hearings for the purpose of reviewing a prisoner’s parole suitability, or the setting, postponing, or rescinding of parole dates, and provides prisoners and victims specified rights at these hearings.
This bill would require notification of the district attorney of the county in which the offense was committed, or his or her designee, to receive notification of specified parole proceedings.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 3041.5 of the Penal Code proposed by SB 230 that would become operative if this bill and SB 230 are both chaptered and this bill is chaptered last.","Requires: (1) a prisoner to be permitted to review and respond to material in his or her file at least ten days prior to a hearing by the Board of Parole Hearings, and to be permitted to be present, to ask and answer questions, and to speak on his or her own behalf; (2) a person designated by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to be present to ensure that all facts relevant to the decision are presented; (3) the prisoner and person to request and receive a stenographic record of all proceedings; and (4) the board to set a date to reconsider whether an inmate should be released on parole that ensures a meaningful consideration of whether the inmate is suitable for release on parole. <n>Requires the board: (1) within ten days following a meeting where a parole date has been set, to send the prisoner a written statement setting forth his or her parole date, the conditions he or she must meet in order to be released on the date set, and the consequences of failure to meet those conditions; (2) within 20 days following a meeting where a parole date has not been set, to send the prisoner a written statement setting forth the reason for refusal to set a parole date, and suggest that consideration of the public and victims safety does not require a more lengthy period of"
"Existing law, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, protects the right to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination because of race, religious creed, physical disability, mental disability, sex, age, and sexual orientation, among other characteristics. The act prohibits various forms of employment discrimination, including discharging or refusing to hire or to select for training programs on a prohibited basis. The act prescribes requirements for filing complaints of employment discrimination with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing and charges this department with investigating and determining whether or not to bring a civil action on behalf of the complainant, among other duties. The act exempts employers from remedies for specified unlawful employment practices, including when the discrimination is on the basis of physical or mental disability and the disability prevents the employee from safely performing essential duties even with reasonable accommodations. The act excludes from the definition of “employee,” any individual employed under a special license in a nonprofit sheltered workshop or rehabilitation facility. A special license permits the employment of individuals with disabilities at a wage less than the legal minimum wage.
This bill would authorize an individual employed under a special license in a nonprofit sheltered workshop, day program, or rehabilitation facility to bring an action under the act for any form of harassment or discrimination prohibited by the act. The bill would provide an employer against whom the individual brings this action with an affirmative defense by proving, by a preponderance of evidence, that the challenged action was permitted by statute or regulation and was necessary to serve employees with disabilities under a special license. The bill would exempt an employer’s obtaining a special license, or hiring or employing a qualified individual at a wage less than the minimum wage in conformity with a special license, from the act’s provisions prohibiting discrimination based on disability. The bill would provide that the definition of employee was not intended to permit the harassment of, or discrimination against, an individual employed under a special license in a nonprofit sheltered workshop, day program, or rehabilitation facility.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)Affirmative relief or prospective relief: (1) includes the authority to order reinstatement of an employee, awards of backpay, reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, hiring, transfers, reassignments, grants of tenure, promotions, cease and desist orders, posting of notices, training of personnel, testing, expunging of records, reporting of records, and any other similar relief that is intended to correct unlawful practices; and (2) includes the authority to order reinstatement of an employee, awards of backpay, reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, hiring, transfers, reassignments, grants of tenure, promotions, cease and desist orders, posting of notices, training of personnel, testing, expunging of records, reporting of records, and any other similar relief that is intended to correct unlawful practices. Defines: (1) age to mean the chronological age of any individual who has reached his or her 40th birthday; (2) mental disability to mean any mental or psychological disorder or condition, such as intellectual disability, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, or specific learning disabilities, that limits a major life activity"
"Existing law requires the Department of Fish and Wildlife to administer the Significant Natural Areas Program, and requires the department, among other things, to develop and maintain a spatial data system that identifies those areas in the state that are most essential for maintaining habitat connectivity, including wildlife corridors and habitat linkages. Existing law requires the department, contingent upon the provision of certain funding, to investigate, study, and identify those areas in the state that are most essential as wildlife corridors and habitat linkages and prioritize vegetative data development in those areas. Existing law requires the department to seek input from representatives of other state agencies, local government, federal agencies, nongovernmental conservation organizations, landowners, agriculture, recreation, scientific entities, and industry in determining essential wildlife corridors and habitat linkages.
This bill would declare that it is the policy of the state to encourage, wherever feasible and practicable, voluntary steps to protect the functioning of wildlife corridors through various means, as applicable.
Existing law provides for the establishment of conservation banks, defined as publicly or privately owned and operated sites that are to be conserved and managed for habitat protection purposes in accordance with an agreement with the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Existing law provides for the issuance of credits by a conservation bank to, among other things, reduce adverse impacts to fish or wildlife resources from certain activities. Existing law also provides for the establishment of mitigation banks, as defined.
This bill would include within the authorized purposes of a conservation bank the protection of habitat connectivity for fish and wildlife resources.
This bill would provide that the fact that a project applicant does not take voluntary steps to protect the functioning of a wildlife corridor prior to initiating the application process for the project shall not be grounds for denying a permit or requiring additional mitigation beyond what is otherwise required by law to mitigate project impacts.","Amends the Fish and Game Code to require the Department of the Interior, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to investigate, study, and identify those areas in California that are most essential as well as the impacts to those corridors from climate change and to prioritize vegetative data development in these areas."
"Existing law, the Dental Practice Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of registered dental hygienists, registered dental hygienists in extended functions, and registered dental hygienists in alternative practice by the Dental Hygiene Committee of California. Existing law authorizes a registered dental hygienist in alternative practice to practice pursuant to specified provisions of law as, among other things, an independent contractor or an employee of a specified clinic. Existing law, the Moscone-Knox Professional Corporation Act, prohibits a professional corporation from rendering professional services in this state without a currently effective certificate of registration issued by the governmental agency regulating the profession in which the corporation is or proposes to be engaged and excepts any professional corporation rendering professional services by persons duly licensed by specified state entities from that requirement. Existing law authorizes specified healing arts licensees to be shareholders, officers, directors, or professional employees of a designated professional corporation, subject to certain limitations relating to ownership of shares. However, existing law specifies that it does not limit employment by a designated professional corporation to only those healing arts licensees and authorizes any healing arts licensee to be employed to render professional services by a designated professional corporation.
This bill would additionally except any professional corporation rendering professional services by persons duly licensed by the Dental Hygiene Committee of California from the certificate of registration requirement. The bill would authorize registered dental assistants, licensed dentists, registered dental hygienists, and registered dental hygienists in extended functions to be shareholders, officers, directors, or professional employees of a registered dental hygienist in alternative practice corporation. The bill would, in the Dental Practice Act, authorize a registered dental hygienist in alternative practice to practice as an employee of a professional corporation, as specified. The bill would make it unprofessional conduct to violate, attempt to violate, assist in or abet the violation of, or conspire to violate, specified provisions regarding registered dental hygienists in alternative practice corporations, the Moscone-Knox Professional Corporation Act, or any regulations adopted under those laws. The bill would require a licensee employed by, or practicing in, a registered dental hygienist in alternative practice corporation to practice within the scope of their license and be subject to all applicable licensure provisions in their respective practice act. The bill would require the bylaws of a registered dental hygienist in alternative practice corporation to include a provision requiring the capital stock of a disqualified or deceased person to be sold to specified parties within a specified period of time. The bill would also require such a corporation to provide security for claims by patients.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2003.

"Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health and sets forth its powers and duties, as specified. Existing law requires the department to maintain a program of maternal, child, and adolescent health.
This bill would require the department to prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report on maternal mortality and morbidity in California, including an analysis of maternal deaths and severe maternal morbidity. The bill would also require the department, in order to develop accurate reports in a resource-efficient manner, to consider existing resources, including, among others, opportunities for partnerships with other entities and use of physician volunteers.
This bill would establish a maternal mortality review panel to conduct ongoing comprehensive, multidisciplinary reviews of maternal deaths and severe maternal morbidity in California to identify factors associated with the deaths and make recommendations for system changes to improve health care services for women in this state. The bill would also make information, documents, proceedings, records, and opinions created, collected, or maintained by the maternity mortality review panel or the State Department of Public Health in support of the maternal mortality review panel confidential and not subject to public inspection, discovery, or introduction into evidence in any civil action. The bill would also prohibit any person in attendance at a meeting of the maternal mortality review panel or who participates in the creation, collection, or maintenance of the panel’s information, documents, proceedings, records, or opinions to testify in any civil action as to the content of those proceedings or the panel’s information, documents, records, or opinions. The bill would require the State Department of Public Health to review department available data to identify maternal deaths and would mandate health care providers, health care facilities, clinics, laboratories, medical examiners, coroners, professionals, and facilities licensed by the State Department of Public Health to provide documents, as specified, upon request of the department. The bill also requires the State Department of Public Health to prepare and submit to the Legislature a biennial report on maternal mortality in California based on the data collected.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","Requires the state of California to establish an ongoing multidisciplinary panel for maternal mortality and severe morbidity reviews, including reports to the Legislature. Defines ""maternal death"" as death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of delivering or following the end of a pregnancy when the woman is from medical causes, including suicide, and is related to or aggravated by the medical causes, including suicide."
"Existing law, the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009, provides, among other things, for student protections and regulatory oversight of private postsecondary institutions in the state. The act is enforced by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education within the Department of Consumer Affairs. The act exempts an institution from its provisions, if any of a list of specific criteria are met.
This bill would exempt from the provisions of the act a bona fide organization, association, or council that offers preapprenticeship training programs on behalf of one or more labor-management apprenticeship programs that are approved by the Division of Apprenticeship Standards if the organization, association, or council satisfies specified requirements.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2010.

Includes among those exempted a bona fide organization, association, or council that offers preapprenticeship training programs on behalf of one or more Division of Apprenticeship Standards-approved labor-management apprenticeship programs that satisfies one of the following conditions: (1) it is not on the Eligible Training Provider List established and maintained by the California Workforce Investment Board but has met the requirements for placement on the list; and (2) it"
"Existing law establishes the Public Safety Communications Division within the Office of Emergency Services, under the supervision of a chief, to carry out specific duties relating to state needs and plans for public safety communications systems and equipment.
This bill would require the division to require its California 911 Emergency Communications Branch to work with the Department of the California Highway Patrol to continue the work of the Routing on Empirical Data (RED) Project by using the technology and procedures employed in that project to assist in determining whether wireless 911 calls should be routed to a local public safety answering point or a California Highway Patrol call center. The bill would require that the project use historical empirical call data to determine the most efficient routing for wireless 911 calls.
The Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act generally imposes a surcharge on amounts paid by every person in the state for intrastate telephone service to provide revenues sufficient to fund “911” emergency telephone system costs, and requires the Office of Emergency Services to annually determine the surcharge rate, subject to a specified formula, that it estimates will produce sufficient revenue to fund the current fiscal year’s 911 costs, as specified.
This bill would instead impose the surcharge at a flat monthly rate of between $0.15 and $0.75, determined annually by the office.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 16, 2014. (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to repeal the excise tax on telecommunications services and direct the Department of the Treasury to transfer the revenue to the Office of Emergency Services for the state of California to carry out its 911 project. The Office of Emergency Services is required to: (1) determine the annual surcharge rate for the state to pay for 911 services; and (2) prepare a summary of the calculation of the proposed surcharge and make it available to the public, the Legislature, the 911 Advisory Board, and on the office's website.

"Existing law establishes a workers’ compensation system to compensate an employee for injuries arising out of, and in the course of, his or her employment. Existing law designates illnesses and conditions that constitute a compensable injury for various employees, such as California Highway Patrol members, firefighters, and certain peace officers. These injuries include, but are not limited to, hernia, pneumonia, heart trouble, cancer, meningitis, and exposure to a biochemical substance when the illness or condition develops or manifests itself during a period when the officer or employee is in service of his or her employer, as specified.
This bill would expand the coverage of the above provisions relating to compensable injury, to include other, full-time peace officers described pursuant to specified provisions of law. The bill would also expand the coverage of these provisions to

"Existing law authorizes the legislative body of a city, county, or city and county to collect any fee, cost, or charge incurred in specified activities, including the abatement of public nuisances, enforcement of specified zoning ordinances, inspections and abatement of violations of the State Housing Law, inspections and abatement of violations of the California Building Standards Code, and inspections and abatement of violations related to local ordinances that implement these laws. Existing law limits the amount of this fee, cost, or charge to the actual cost incurred performing the inspections and enforcement activity, including permit fees, fines, late charges, and interest.
Existing law authorizes the legislative body of a local agency to make, by ordinance, any violation of an ordinance subject to an administrative fine or penalty and limits the maximum fine or penalty amounts for infractions, as specified. For violations of city or county building and safety codes determined to be an infraction, existing law limits the amount of the fine to $100 for a first violation, $500 for a 2nd violation of the same ordinance within one year, and $1,000 for each additional violation of the same ordinance within one year of the first violation.
This bill would authorize a county to establish administrative fines, not to exceed specified limits, for violations of certain county ordinances, including a county building and safety ordinance, brush removal ordinance, grading ordinance, film permit ordinance, or zoning ordinance, determined to be an infraction, subject to certain county findings.","(Sec. 1) Makes California a misdemeanor unless a violation of a county ordinance is made an infraction, which may be prosecuted by county authorities in the name of the people of California, or redressed by civil action.

"(1) The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law allow various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws, including, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2012, and before January 1, 2017, a credit for qualified taxpayers, defined as the person responsible for planting a crop, managing the crop, and harvesting the crop from the land, in an amount equal to 10% of the cost that would otherwise be included in, or required to be included in, inventory costs, as specified under federal law, with respect to the donation of fresh fruits or fresh vegetables to food banks located in California.
This bill, under both laws, would expand the credit to apply to the donation of qualified donation items, defined as raw agricultural products or processed foods. The bill would expand the definition of qualified taxpayer to also include the person responsible for growing or raising a qualified donation item, or harvesting, packing, or processing a qualified donation item. The bill would modify the credit amount to instead equal 15% of the qualified value, as defined, of the qualified donation items, but not less than an amount that would otherwise be calculated and allowed under existing law. The bill would extend the operation of the credit to taxable years before January 1, 2021, and would require it to be claimed on a timely filed original return. The bill would make various conforming changes and would also make a nonsubstantive change to the personal income tax provision.
(2) Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish and administer the State Emergency Food Assistance Program (SEFAP), to provide food and funding for the provision of emergency food to food banks, as provided. Existing law creates the State Emergency Food Assistance Program Account and, upon appropriation by the Legislature, would allocate the moneys in the account to SEFAP and require that those moneys be used for the purchase, storage, and transportation of food grown or produced in California and for the department’s administrative costs.
This bill would rename the State Emergency Food Assistance Program (SEFAP) as the CalFood Program and would rename the State Emergency Food Assistance Program Account as the CalFood Account. The bill would make other conforming changes in this regard.","Allows individual taxpayers who donate certain raw agricultural products or processed foods to a California food bank a tax credit equal to 15% of the value of such items. Defines ""qualified donation item"" as fresh fruits or fresh vegetables and certain raw agricultural products or processed foods."
"The California Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1973 provides the Division of Occupational Safety and Health within the Department of Industrial Relations with the power, jurisdiction, and supervision over all employment and places of employment necessary to enforce and administer all occupational health and safety laws and to protect employees. The Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board, an independent entity within the department, has the exclusive authority to adopt occupational safety and health standards within the state.
This bill would require the board, by June 1, 2017, to adopt a standard that requires an employer performing corrosion prevention work on industrial and infrastructure projects to use trained and certified personnel, as specified. Because certain violations of these new requirements would be a misdemeanor, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

The bill would require the franchisor, within a specified period, to notify the franchisee of the approval or disapproval of the proposed sale, assignment, or transfer of the franchise, and would require the notice to be in writing and be delivered by courier to the franchisee or sent by receipted mail. The bill would require the franchisor to communicate the franchisor’s standards for approval of new or renewing franchisees, as specified. The bill would deem a proposed sale, assignment, or transfer approved, unless disapproved by the franchisor, as specified.
The act requires a franchisor that terminates or fails to renew a franchise, other than in accordance with specified provisions of law, to offer to repurchase from the franchisee the franchisee’s resalable current inventory, as specified.

The bill would not require a franchisor to purchase assets to which the franchisee cannot or does not provide clear title and possession.
This bill would entitle a franchisee to receive from the franchisor the fair market value of the franchise business and assets, as well as resulting damages, if a franchisor terminates or fails to renew a franchise in violation of the act. The bill would provide for injunctive relief in the event of a violation or threatened violation of these provisions.

Existing law requires notice prior to the suspension or forfeiture of a taxpayer’s corporate powers, rights, and privileges. Existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to transmit to the Secretary of State the names of those taxpayers subject to these suspension or forfeiture provisions and thereby makes the suspension or forfeiture effective.

Under existing law, every corporation, except as specified, is subject to the minimum franchise tax until the effective date of dissolution or withdrawal or, if later, the date the corporation ceases to do business within the limits of this state. Upon certification by the Secretary of State that a nonprofit public benefit corporation or a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation has failed to file the required Statement of Information, existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to assess a specified penalty.
This bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to abate, upon written request by a qualified nonprofit corporation, as defined, unpaid qualified taxes, interest, and penalties, as defined, for the taxable years in which the nonprofit corporation certifies, under penalty of perjury, that it was not doing business, as defined. The bill would make this abatement conditioned on the dissolution of the qualified corporation within a specified period of time of filing the request for abatement. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out these abatement provisions and would exempt these rules and regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act.
(4) Existing state constitutional law prohibits the Legislature from making any gift, or authorizing the making of any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any individual, municipal, or other corporation.
This bill would make certain legislative findings and declarations that abatement of a nonprofit corporation’s liabilities for specified taxes, penalties, and interest serves a public purpose, as provided.
(5) By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill provides that a nonprofit corporation or foreign corporation that has qualified to transact intrastate business shall be subject to administrative dissolution or administrative surrender in accordance with this bill if, as of January 1, 2016, or later, the corporation's or corporation's corporate powers are, and have been, suspended or forfeited by the Franchise Tax Board for a period of not less than 48 continuous months.

"Under existing law, the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, the State Department of Developmental Services is required to contract with regional centers to provide services and supports to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Existing law requires the Director of Developmental Services to establish, annually review, and adjust as needed, a schedule of parental fees to be paid by parents of children under 18 years of age who are receiving 24-hour out-of-home care services through a regional center or who are residents of a state hospital or on leave from the state hospital.
Existing law provides that all parental fees collected by or for regional centers are remitted to the State Treasury to be deposited in the Program Development Fund, a continuously appropriated fund.
This bill would, effective July 1, 2016, revise and recast those provisions by, among other things, calculating monthly parental fees based on a percentage of the parents’ annual income and authorizing a credit of the equivalent of one day of the monthly parental fee for each day a child spends 6 or more consecutive hours in a 24-hour period on a home visit. The bill would prohibit a monthly parental fee from exceeding the maximum monthly cost of caring for a child or the cost of services provided, whichever is less. The bill would require, for parents of children placed in 24-hour out-of-home care prior to July 1, 2016, the monthly parental fee to be calculated at the time of the parents’ annual fee recalculation, or within 60 days of a parental request for review by the department and receipt of the family’s completed family financial statement. The bill would provide that the Program Development Fund is available upon appropriation by the Legislature and make other related and conforming changes.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to require all parental fees collected by or for regional centers to be remitted to the State Treasury to be deposited into the Developmental Disabilities Program Development Fund, established in the Treasury, to provide resources needed to initiate new programs and to expand or convert existing programs.

"Existing law provides for the regulation of specified insurance products, including group life insurance, by the Insurance Commissioner. Existing law provides that insurance under a group life insurance policy may be extended to insure the dependents of each insured employee under the group policy, as specified. Existing law defines a dependent for these purposes as including the employee’s spouse and all children from birth until 26 years of age, or a child 26 years of age or older who is both incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of intellectual disability or physical handicap and chiefly dependent upon the employee for support and maintenance, as specified.
This bill would clarify that for dependent children over the age of majority the group policyholder would be authorized to elect coverage at age variations up to the limiting age.
Existing law defines a waiver of premium benefit or a waiver of monthly deduction benefit under a life insurance contract as a supplemental benefit that operates to safeguard a life insurance contract against lapse when the insured becomes totally disabled, as defined by the supplemental benefit, and continues until the end of the insured’s disability or the period specified by the supplemental benefit, consistent with specified restrictions. Existing law requires, if the insured’s total disability begins before the insured attains 60 years of age, the insurer to waive all premiums or monthly deductions due for the period that the insured continues to be totally disabled. Existing law requires, if the insured’s total disability begins when the insured is 60 years of age or older, the insurer to waive all premiums or monthly deductions due for the period that the insured continues to be totally disabled up to 65 years of age.
This bill would require an insurer, for an insured who becomes totally disabled before attaining 60 years of age and is covered by a group life insurance policy that includes a supplemental benefit, to waive all premiums or monthly deductions due for the period of total disability up to the time the insured attains 65 years of age. The bill would also permit an insurer to collect premiums or monthly deductions from an insured who becomes totally disabled on or after 60 years of age and is covered by a group life insurance policy that includes a supplemental benefit. The bill would require an insurer offering a renewal for a group life insurance policy issued prior to January 1, 2017, that contains a supplemental benefit to offer the employer a continuation of the in-force supplemental benefit, and would authorize the insurer to concurrently offer the group policyholder the option to change the supplemental benefit to either waive or collect premiums or monthly deductions as described above.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 14, 2016. (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Insurance Code, with respect to group life insurance, to allow an insurer to continue a group life insurance policy on behalf of an insured employee and his or her dependents if the insurer so elects in amounts in accordance with some plan that preclude individual selection and that shall not be in excess of 100% of the insurance on the life of the insured employee. The premiums for such insurance may be paid by the employer, the employee, or the employee jointly. For dependent children over the age of majority, the group policyholder may elect coverage at age variations up to the limiting age, including members of a spouse or a minor child, as well as a child older than 26 years of age, or any child over the age of majority who is both incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of an intellectual disability or physical handicap and dependent upon the employee for support maintenance if proof incapacity and dependency is furnished to the employee within 31 days of the child's attainment of the limiting age.

Existing law, until January 1, 2019, also requires the instrument, if funds for the instrument derive from the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998 or from any future state school bond for a public project that involves a projected expenditure of $1,000,000 or more, to provide that the person, firm, or corporation that constructs the building shall comply with specified prequalification requirements.
Existing law also authorizes the governing board of a school district to enter into an agreement with the lowest responsible bidder to construct, or provide for the construction of, a building to be leased and used by the school district upon a designated site if the instrument provides that the title to the building and site shall vest in the school district at the end of the lease.

Greene School Facilities Act of 1998 or from any future state school bond for a public project that involves a projected expenditure of $1,000,000 or more, to provide that the person, firm, or corporation that constructs the building shall comply with specified prequalification requirements.
This bill would, until January 1, 2019, require the instrument and agreement to provide that the person, firm, or corporation that constructs the building to comply with specified prequalification requirements in this context regardless of the funding source for the public project. The bill would require that certain conditions relating to the use of a skilled and trained workforce on the project or contract be satisfied before the governing board of a school district may enter into a contract with any entity for the construction, or for providing for the construction of, a building to be leased or used by the school district.
Existing law requires, until January 1, 2019, the governing board of a school district that enters into a contract for a public project, as defined, for which the board uses moneys received pursuant to the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998 or moneys from future state school bonds for a public project that involves a projected expenditure of $1,000,000 or more, to require prospective bidders for a construction contract to complete and submit a standardized prequalification questionnaire and financial statement, as provided.
This bill would impose these requirements on a public project if funding for the project includes reimbursement from any future state school bond.","This bill amends the California Education Code to allow the governing board of a school district, without advertising for bids, to let a person, firm, or corporation real property that belongs to it for a minimum rental of one dollar $1 per year if the instrument by which the property is let requires the lessee to construct on the demised premises, or provide for the construction of a building or buildings for the use of the school district during the term of the lease, and provides that title to that building shall vest in the school district at the expiration of that term. The instrument may provide for the means or methods by which that title shall vest in the school district before the expiration of that term and shall contain other terms and conditions as the governing board may deem to be in the best interest of the school district. An instrument created pursuant to this bill shall require that a person, firm, or corporation that constructs the building, including the prime contractor and, if used, electrical, mechanical, and plumbing subcontractor, shall be subject to the same prequalification requirements for prospective bidders under the Public Contract Code, including the requirement for the completion and submission of a standardized prequalification questionnaire and financial statement that is verified under oath and is not a public record."
"(1) The California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009 provides for the regulation of private postsecondary educational institutions by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education in the Department of Consumer Affairs. The act also establishes the Student Tuition Recovery Fund and requires the bureau to adopt regulations governing the administration and maintenance of the fund, including requirements relating to assessments on students and student claims against the fund, and establishes that the moneys in this fund are continuously appropriated to the bureau for specified purposes. The act caps the amount that may be in the fund at any time at $25,000,000.
This bill would raise the cap for the fund to $30,000,000.
(2) This bill would appropriate the sum of $1,300,000 from the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to the Attorney General for the purposes of providing grants to eligible nonprofit community service organizations to assist eligible students affected by the closure of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., as defined, with loan discharge and other student loan-related requests and tuition recovery-related claims, and to pay an amount not to exceed $150,000 for the reasonable administrative costs of the Attorney General’s office related to these grants, as specified, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would require the bureau to notify the Attorney General of all unlawful Corinthian Colleges, Inc., closures within 15 days of the effective date of these provisions. The bill would require the Attorney General to, among other things, within 90 days of the notification, solicit grant applications from eligible nonprofit community service organizations, select one or more of these organizations deemed to be qualified, and set additional terms and conditions of the grants as necessary. The bill would set a schedule for how grant funds are to be distributed. The bill would require the grantee to submit specified information to the Attorney General on a quarterly basis, and require the Attorney General to make these reports available to the Legislature and the bureau upon request. The bill would require the Attorney General to provide the Legislature and the bureau a final report summarizing all the information submitted to it by grantees, promptly following the time when all funds are expended by the grantees, or by August, 1, 2018, whichever is earlier. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to contract with another qualified entity to perform the Attorney General’s duties under these provisions.
(3) This bill would, for a period not to exceed 2 years from April 27, 2015, authorize state agencies that provide certification, registration, or licensure necessary to promote the safety and protection of the public to, on a case-by-case basis, consider for certification, registration, or licensure students who were enrolled in a program of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., that provided education or training aimed towards these students receiving certification, registration, or licensure from the state agency, and who did not receive that certification, registration, or licensure due to the closure of that institution.
(4) The Cal Grant Program prohibits an applicant from receiving Cal Grant awards totaling in excess of the amount equivalent to the award level for a total of four years of full-time attendance in an undergraduate program, except as provided.
This bill would partially exempt from this limitation on Cal Grant awards a student who was enrolled and received a Cal Grant award at a California campus of Heald College, and who was unable to complete an educational program offered by the campus due to its closure.
(5) The California National Guard Education Assistance Award Program authorizes the renewal of California National Guard Education Assistance Awards, for a maximum of the greater of either four years of full-time equivalent enrollment or the duration for which the qualifying member would otherwise be eligible pursuant to the Cal Grant Program, if specified conditions are met.
This bill would partially exempt from this limitation on California National Guard Education Assistance Awards a student who was enrolled and received a California National Guard Education Assistance Award at a California campus of Heald College, and who was unable to complete an educational program offered by the campus due to its closure.

"Existing law establishes the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board in the Department of Industrial Relations to adopt, amend, or repeal employment safety standards and laws. Existing law authorizes the board, upon the application of an employer, to grant a permanent variance from an occupational standard or order after specified notice and hearing requirements are met. The California Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1973 also authorizes an employer to apply to the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, that enforces employment safety laws, for a temporary order granting a variance from an occupational safety or health standard and requires the order to be granted only if the employer’s application satisfies specified requirements. Existing law provides that a temporary order may be granted only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a hearing.

The bill would require any affected worker, or representative of affected workers, upon request, to be granted party status to the variance proceedings. The bill would require the variance application to include a certification that the employer has given notice to affected workers as required. Because a violation of the new requirements for employers would be a crime under certain circumstances, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Labor Code (the Code) to require the California Occupational Safety and Health Board to conduct hearings on requests for a permanent variance from occupational safety and health standards after an applicant is properly notified.

The bill would provide that fines collected pursuant to these provisions would be deposited in the Child Health and Safety Fund. The bill would also require the department to develop regulations for these purposes as specified.","This bill requires an online child care job posting service to include information regarding each child care provider profile or Internet page that lists such providers, including a link to the California Trustline registry and a description of the availability of free child care referrals in every county."
"Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, provides for the comprehensive regulation of campaign financing, including requiring the reporting of campaign contributions and expenditures and imposing other reporting and recordkeeping requirements on campaign committees. The act requires elected officers, candidates, and committees to file various reports, including semiannual reports, preelection statements, and supplemental preelection statements.
This bill would recast the requirements for filing preelection statements and would repeal other reporting requirements, including supplemental preelection statements and supplemental independent expenditure reports.
The act defines “committee” to include a person or combination of persons who receives contributions or makes independent expenditures of $1,000 or more in a calendar year. The act defines “late contributions” and “late independent expenditures” for purposes of the act to include certain contributions and independent expenditures, respectively, that are made within 90 days before the date of the election.
This bill would revise the definition of “committee” by increasing the qualifying monetary threshold to $2,000 for contributions received by a person or combination of persons.
This bill would revise the definitions of “late contributions” and “late independent expenditures” to specify that those terms also include contributions and independent expenditures that are made on the date of the election.
The bill would also make conforming changes.
A violation of the act’s provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

The act requires a notice to be provided if an insurance policy described in the annual budget report lapses, is canceled, or is not immediately renewed, restored, or replaced, or if there is a significant change as to the policy.
This bill would, beginning July 1, 2016, require the annual budget report of a condominium project to also include a separate statement describing the status of the common interest development as a Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-approved condominium project and as a federal Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-approved condominium project.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on June 23, 2016.

"Existing law provides generally for procedures governing civil actions. Existing law imposes additional procedures that apply with respect to limited types of civil actions.
This bill would enact the Asbestos Tort Claim Trust Transparency Act, which would establish additional procedures with respect to civil actions pertaining to asbestos tort claims, as defined. The bill would, among other things, require that a plaintiff produce, at the same time he or she serves answers to interrogatories, all asbestos trust claim documents, as specified, and would provide that these documents are not subject to a claim of privilege. The bill would also require the plaintiff, in answering interrogatories, to disclose the facts related to his or her alleged exposure to asbestos. The bill would authorize a defendant to file a motion to compel the plaintiff’s compliance with the production and disclosure requirements, as described above. The bill would require the court to retain jurisdiction over an asbestos tort action for 4 years after entry of judgment for certain purposes.
Existing law requires a court to grant a petition of a party to a civil action who is over 70 years of age for a preference if the court makes certain findings. Existing law authorizes a court to grant a motion for preference that is supported by a showing that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be served by granting this preference.
This bill provide that a plaintiff is entitled to a trial preference if he or she has complied with specific disclosure requirements and would require a plaintiff in an asbestos tort action who files a motion for preference to submit a sworn affidavit that he or she has complied with those disclosure requirements.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Code of Civil Procedure to allow a party to a civil action who is over 70 years of age to petition the court for preference, which the court shall grant if the court makes both of the following findings: (1) the party has a substantial interest in the action as a whole; and (2) the health of the party is such that preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party's interest in the litigation. Entitles a civil action to recover damages for wrongful death or personal injury to preference upon the motion of any party under 14 years of age unless the court finds that the party does not have a substantial interest in the case as a whole.

"Existing law regulates the operation of bicycles, motorized scooters, and electric personal assistive mobility devices, as defined. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions punishable as an infraction.
This bill would define the term “electrically motorized board.” The bill would prohibit the operation of an electrically motorized board upon a highway while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug. The bill would require the operator of an electrically motorized board to wear a helmet while operating an electrically motorized board upon a highway, bikeway, or any other public bicycle path, sidewalk, or trail. The bill would require an operator to be at least 16 years of age in order to operate an electrically motorized board. The bill would also require electrically motorized boards to be equipped with safety equipment, as specified, and restrict the operation speed of electrically motorized boards. Because a violation of these provisions would be punishable as an infraction, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would also require the Commissioner of the California Highway Patrol to submit a report, as specified, to the Legislature, on or before January 1, 2021, to assist in determining the effect that the use of electrically motorized boards has on traffic safety.

Existing law makes it a crime to operate a motorized skateboard on any sidewalk, roadway, or any other part of a highway or on any bikeway, bicycle path or trail, equestrian trail, or hiking or recreational trail.
This bill would provide that an electrically motorized board is not a motorized skateboard for those purposes.
Existing law authorizes the Department of Transportation and local authorities to prohibit or restrict the use of bicycles, motorized bicycles, and motorized scooters upon freeways or expressways.
This bill would authorize the Department of Transportation and local authorities to also prohibit or restrict the use of electrically motorized boards upon freeways or expressways.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 21113 of the Vehicle Code proposed by AB 1096 that would become operative only if this bill and AB 1096 are both chaptered, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

Existing law requires a real estate broker who accepts funds belonging to others in connection with a transaction to deposit all those funds in either a neutral escrow depository, into the hands of the broker’s principal, or into a trust fund account, as specified.
This bill would authorize certain persons, including, among others, a real estate salesperson licensed to the broker to withdraw funds from a trust fund account of the broker if specifically authorized in writing. The bill would authorize an unlicensed employee of the broker to withdraw funds from the broker’s trust fund account if the broker has fidelity bond coverage equal to the maximum amount of the trust funds to which the unlicensed employee has access to at any time. The bill would authorize this bond to have a deductible of up to 5% of the coverage amount, if the employing broker has evidence of financial responsibility and require financial responsibility to be a separate fidelity bond coverage or a cash deposit adequate to cover the amount of the fidelity bond deductible, as specified, or any other evidence of financial responsibility approved by the commissioner. The bill would prohibit an arrangement from relieving the persons authorized by a broker or officer from responsibility or liability in handling trust funds in the broker’s custody, as specified.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 12, 2003.

"Prior law required, until July 1, 2015, the obligation of a person to pay child support pursuant to an order that is being enforced by a local child support agency under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act to be suspended for the period of time exceeding 90 days in which the person required to pay support is incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized, with specified exceptions. Prior law required that, upon the release of the obligor, the obligation to pay child support immediately resume in the amount otherwise specified in the child support order prior to the suspension of that obligation. Prior law required the court to provide notice to the parties of the support obligation suspension at the time the order was issued or modified. Prior law authorized an obligor, upon release from incarceration or involuntary institutionalization, to petition the court for an adjustment of the arrears pursuant to the suspension of the support obligation.
This bill would enact similar provisions to require the suspension of a child support order to occur by operation of law when an obligor is incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized, unless the obligor has the means to pay support, or the obligor was incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized for either an offense constituting domestic violence or the failure to pay child support. The bill would also authorize the local child support agency to administratively adjust account balances for a money judgment or order for support of a child that is suspended by operation of law if the agency verifies that arrears and interest were accrued in violation of these provisions, that specified conditions relating to the obligor’s inability to pay while incarcerated and the underlying offense for which he or she was incarcerated do not exist, and neither the obligor nor the obligee object to the adjustment. The bill would require the local child support agency to give notice, as prescribed, of the adjustment to the obligor and obligee. If either the obligor or the obligee objects to the adjustment, the bill would require the agency to file a motion with the court to adjust the arrears and would allow the adjustment only after approval by the court. The bill would require the child support obligation to resume on the first day of the first full month after the release of the person owing support. The bill would require the Department of Child Support Services, in consultation with the Judicial Council, to develop forms to implement these provisions, and would require them to report specified information relating to these provisions to the Assembly Judiciary Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee on or before January 1, 2019. The bill would make these provisions operative only until January 1, 2020.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","This bill amends the Family Code, with respect to child support, to suspend a money judgment or order for support of a child for any period exceeding 90 consecutive days in which the person ordered to pay support is incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized unless: (1) the person owing support has the means to pay support while incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized; or (2) the person owing support was incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized for an offense constituting domestic violence, against the supported party or supported child, or for an offense that could be enjoined by a protective order pursuant to Section 6320, or as a result of his or her failure to comply with a court order to pay child support. The child support obligation shall resume on the first day of the first full month after the release of the person owing support in the amount previously ordered. A local child support agency enforcing a child support order under title IV-D of the Social Security Act may, upon written notice of the proposed adjustment to the support obligor or obligee along with a blank form provided for the support obligor or obligee to object to the administrative adjustment to the agency, administratively adjust account for a money judgment or order for support of a child suspended pursuant to this bill"
"Existing law requires certain health care practitioners and pharmacists to apply to the Department of Justice to obtain approval to access information contained in the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) regarding the controlled substance history of a patient under his or her care. Existing law requires the Department of Justice, upon approval of an application, to provide the approved health care practitioner or pharmacist the history of controlled substances dispensed to an individual under his or her care. Existing law authorizes an application to be denied, or a subscriber to be suspended, for specified reasons, including, among others, a subscriber accessing information for any reason other than caring for his or her patients.
This bill would also authorize an individual designated to investigate a holder of a professional license to apply to the Department of Justice to obtain approval to access information contained in the CURES PDMP regarding the controlled substance history of an applicant or a licensee for the purpose of investigating the alleged substance abuse of a licensee. The bill would, upon approval of an application, require the department to provide to the approved individual the history of controlled substances dispensed to the licensee. The bill would clarify that only a subscriber who is a health care practitioner or a pharmacist may have an application denied or be suspended for accessing subscriber information for any reason other than caring for his or her patients. The bill would also specify that an application may be denied, or a subscriber may be suspended, if a subscriber who has been designated to investigate the holder of a professional license accesses information for any reason other than investigating the holder of a professional license.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on November 16, 2015.

This bill would authorize the department to use a streamlined administrative process to update regulatory references to health care standards of practice adopted by a state or national association when outdated standards are already referenced in the California Code of Regulations. The procedure created by this bill would, among other things, require the department to post the update on the department’s Internet Web site, notify stakeholders of the proposed change, submit notice of the proposed change to the Office of Administrative Law for publication in the California Regulatory Notice Register, accept comments, and consider those comments prior to the adoption of the new standards. The bill would require, if a member of the public requests a public hearing, that the department hold a hearing and consider any comments. The bill would, if comments are submitted in opposition to the proposed change, require the department to instead follow the procedures provided for by the Administrative Procedure Act.
Existing law requires inpatient treatment of eating disorders to be provided only in state licensed hospitals. Existing law defines “eating disorders” for these purposes as anorexia nervosa and bulimia as defined in the 1980 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association.
This bill would instead define “eating disorders” to have the meaning of the term as defined in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, as published by the American Psychiatric Association. By changing the definition of a crime applicable to health facilities, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(Sec. 1) Declares that the disease of eating disorders is not simply medical or psychiatric, but involves biological, sociological, psychological, family, stakeholder medical, and spiritual components. Declares that the inpatient treatment of eating disorders shall be provided only in state licensed hospitals, acute psychiatric hospitals, or any other licensed health facility designated by the State Department of Public Health.

This bill would define “in-lieu use” for the purposes of the act and would provide that, where appropriate, measures addressing in-lieu use shall be included in a groundwater sustainability plan.
The act authorizes a groundwater sustainability agency to exercise certain powers in implementing the act, in addition to, and not as a limitation on, any existing authority, if the groundwater sustainability agency adopts and submits to the Department of Water Resources a groundwater sustainability plan or prescribed alternative documentation.
This bill would, in addition to any other authorities granted to a groundwater sustainability agency, authorize a groundwater sustainability agency to enter into written agreements and funding with private parties that assist in or facilitate the implementation of groundwater sustainability plans or elements of a groundwater sustainability plan.
The act, with a specified exception, does not authorize a local agency to impose any requirement on the state or any agency, department, or officer of the state.
This bill, if a groundwater sustainability agency finds that a state entity is not working cooperatively regarding implementation of a groundwater sustainability plan, would permit the groundwater sustainability agency to file notice with the board and require the board to notice proceedings to investigate the finding of the groundwater sustainability agency. This bill would authorize the board to direct the state entity to cooperate in the implementation of the groundwater sustainability plan if the board determines that the failure of the state entity to work cooperatively regarding implementation of a groundwater sustainability plan compromises the ability of the groundwater sustainability agency to implement the plan in a manner that will likely achieve the sustainability goal unless the state entity indicates its authority for not complying with the groundwater sustainability plan.
Existing law, the Integrated Regional Water Management Planning Act, authorizes a regional water management group to prepare and adopt an integrated regional water management plan with specified components relating to water supply and water quality. Existing law authorizes a regional water management group to coordinate its planning activities to address or incorporate all or part of certain actions of its members into its plan, including groundwater management planning.
This bill would specify that groundwater sustainability planning is an action of regional water management group members that may be addressed or incorporated into a regional water management plan.","Amends the Water Code to authorize a regional water management group to prepare and adopt an integrated regional water management plan. Permits a regional water management group to coordinate its planning activities to address or incorporate all or part of any of the following actions of its members into its plan: (1) groundwater management planning; (2) urban water management planning; (3) the preparation of a water supply assessment; (4) agricultural water management planning; (5) city and county general planning; (6) stormwater resource planning; or (7) other water resource management planning, including flood protection, watershed management, and multipurpose program planning.

"Existing law authorizes a value-pricing and transit development program involving high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes to be conducted, administered, developed, and operated on State Highway Routes 10 and 110 in the County of Los Angeles by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) under certain conditions.
Existing law requires LACMTA, in implementing the program, to continue to work with the affected communities in the respective corridors and provide mitigation measures for commuters and transit users of low income, including reduced toll charges and toll credits. Existing law requires eligible commuters and transit users to meet the eligibility requirements for specified assistance programs.
This bill would require LACMTA to take additional steps, beyond the previous implementation of a low-income assistance program, to increase enrollment and participation in the low-income assistance program, as specified, through advertising and work with community organizations and social service agencies. The bill would also require LACMTA and the Department of Transportation to report to the Legislature by December 31, 2018, on efforts to improve the HOT lane program, including efforts to increase participation in the low-income assistance program.","Amends Federal highway law to authorize the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) to conduct, administer, and operate a value-pricing and transit development program involving high-occupancy toll lanes on State Highway Routes 10 and 110 in Los Angeles County."
"Existing law governs the relationship between an employer and an employee with regard to hiring, promotion, discipline, wages and hours, working conditions, and administrative and judicial remedies. Existing law sets forth guidelines for determining whether a person who performs work for another pursuant to a contract is an employee or an independent contractor.

This bill would establish the Motor Carrier Employer Amnesty Program pursuant to which, notwithstanding any law, a motor carrier performing drayage services may be relieved of liability for statutory or civil penalties associated with misclassification of commercial drivers as independent contractors if the motor carrier enters into a settlement agreement with the Labor Commissioner, with the cooperation and consent of the Employment Development Department, prior to January 1, 2017, whereby the motor carrier agrees to convert all of its commercial drivers to employees, and the settlement agreement contains prescribed components, including, but not limited to, an agreement by the motor carrier to pay all wages, benefits, and taxes owed, if any. The bill would permit a settlement agreement to contain a provision authorizing the Labor Commissioner and the Employment Development Department to recover from the motor carrier the reasonable, actual costs of the Labor Commissioner and the Employment Development Department for their respective review, approval, and compliance monitoring of that settlement agreement.","This bill requires the Department of Labor and the Employment Development Department to administer the Motor Carrier Employer Amnesty Program under which, notwithstanding any law, an eligible motor carrier performing drayage services at any port shall be relieved of liability for statutory or civil penalties associated with the misclassification of commercial drivers as independent contractors if the carrier agrees, among other things, to properly classify all of its commercial drivers as employees."
"Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of that act a crime.

This bill would, where an abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drug product, as defined, is available, prohibit a health care service plan or insurer from requiring the use of opioid analgesic drug products without the abuse-deterrent properties in order to access abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drug products. The bill would require a health care service plan or insurer to allow a provider to prescribe, and if otherwise covered, to provide coverage for, a less than 30-day supply of an opioid analgesic drug product. Because a willful violation of these requirements with respect to health care service plans would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, the knowing violation of which is a crime, provides for the licensing and regulation of pharmacists by the California State Board of Pharmacy. Existing regulations require a pharmacist to provide oral consultation to his or her patient or the patient’s agent in all care settings upon request or whenever the pharmacist deems it warranted.
This bill would require a pharmacist to inform a patient receiving an opioid analgesic drug product on proper storage and disposal of the drug, and
authorizes this information to be included as part of the required oral consultation.
would require the board to adopt regulations to implement that provision.
Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires a pharmacist to inform a patient receiving an opioid analgesic drug product on proper storage and disposal. Where an abuse-deterrent opioid analgesic drug product is available, a health care service plan shall not require the use of opioid analgesic drug products without the abuse-deterrent properties in order to access such products.

This bill would instead provide that the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice constitutes the minimum standard of conduct and performance for federally related real estate appraisal activity, as defined. The bill would revise existing, and additionally include new, definitions for specified terms for purposes of the Real Estate Appraisers’ Licensing and Certification Law. The bill would also authorize, if a licensee is performing a nonfederally related appraisal activity, a standard of valuation practice, as defined, for a licensee if that practice is disclosed to, and agreed upon, by the client, and if that practice is described in an appraisal, as provided.","This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to require appraisal management companies to register with the Department of Consumer Affairs. &quot;Appraisal&quot; means a written statement independently and impartially prepared by a qualified appraiser setting forth an opinion in a federally related transaction as to the market value of an adequately described property as of a specific date, supported by the presentation and analysis of relevant market information. An appraisal management company must: (1) maintain an approved list or lists containing 11 or more independent contractor appraisers licensed or certified; (2) receive requests for appraisals from one or more clients; and (3) delegate appraisal assignments for completion by its independent contractor or employee appraisers."
"Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district to request an emergency apportionment through the Superintendent of Public Instruction if the governing board of the school district determines during a fiscal year that its revenues are less than the amount necessary to meet its current year expenditure obligations. Under existing law, if a school district accepts an emergency apportionment, that acceptance constitutes agreement by the school district to numerous conditions, among which is an agreement that the Controller, or his or her designee, or an auditor selected by the school district and approved by the Controller shall conduct an annual audit of the books and accounts of the school district, as specified. This provision requires these audits to continue until the Controller determines, in consultation with the Superintendent, that the school district is financially solvent, but in no event earlier than one year following the implementation of the school district’s fiscal plan or later than the time the apportionment is repaid, including interest.
This bill, for an audit conducted by the Controller, or his or her designee, would require the Controller, the Superintendent, and the school district superintendent, or their respective designees, to meet before the audit to discuss the terms of the audit and the timeline under which it will proceed.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on June 2, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Education Code to allow&nbsp;a county superintendent of schools to appoint, on a short-term basis, a trustee and necessary staff to assist the trustee in a school district's implementation of a fiscal plan. The expenses incurred by the trustee and necessary staff shall be borne by the school district. The trustee and necessary staff shall serve until the school district has adequate fiscal systems and controls in place. The Department of Education, the Legislature, the Department of Finance, and the Controller must, before the school district repays a loan, select an auditor from a list established by the Superintendent and the Controller to conduct an audit of the school district's fiscal systems. The Superintendent may retain the trustee until the deficiencies are corrected."
"Existing law prescribes various requirements regarding the formation, content, and enforcement of state and local public contracts. Existing law applicable to state public contracts generally requires that the resolution of claims related to those contracts be subject to arbitration. Existing law applicable to local agency contracts prescribes a process for the resolution of claims related to those contracts of $375,000 or less.
This bill would establish, for contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2017, a claim resolution process applicable to any claim by a contractor in connection with a public works project. The bill would define a claim as a separate demand by the contractor for one or more of the following: a time extension for relief from damages or penalties for delay, payment of money or damages arising from work done pursuant to the contract for a public work, or payment of an amount disputed by the public entity, as specified.
This bill would require a public entity, defined to exclude certain state entities, upon receipt of a claim sent by registered or certified mail, to review it and, within 45 days, provide a written statement identifying the disputed and undisputed portions of the claim. The bill would authorize the 45-day period to be extended by mutual agreement. The bill would require any payment due on an undisputed portion of the claim to be processed within 60 days, as specified. The bill would require that the claim be deemed rejected in its entirety if the public entity fails to issue the written statement.
This bill would authorize, if the claimant disputes the public entity’s written response or if the public entity fails to respond to a claim within the time prescribed, the claimant to demand to meet and confer for settlement of the issues in dispute. The bill would require any disputed portion of the claim that remains in dispute after the meet and confer conference to be subject to nonbinding mediation, as specified. The bill would provide that unpaid claim amounts accrue interest at 7% per annum. The bill would prescribe a procedure by which a subcontractor or lower tier contractor may make a claim through the contractor.
This bill would require the text of these provisions, or a summary, to be set forth in the plans or specifications for any public work which may give rise to a claim. The bill would specify that a waiver of these rights is void and contrary to public policy, except as specified. The bill would also specify that it does not impose liability on a public entity that makes loans or grants available through a competitive application process, for the failure of an awardee to meet its contractual obligations.
By increasing the duties of local agencies and officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would, on January 1, 2020, repeal the provision establishing the claim resolution process.
This bill would specify that these provisions constitute a matter of statewide concern.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill declares that it is in the best interests of the state and its citizens to ensure that all construction business performed on a public works project in California that is complete and not in dispute is paid in full and in a timely manner. The bill applies to any claim by a contractor in connection with a public works project by: (1) a contractor sent by registered mail or certified mail with return receipt requested, for one or more of the following: a time extension, including, without limitation, for relief from damages or penalties for delay assessed by a public entity under a contract for a public works project; (2) payment by the public entity of money or damages arising from work done by, or on behalf of, the contractor pursuant to the contract for a public works project and payment for which is not otherwise expressly provided or to which the claimant is not otherwise entitled; and (3) a payment of an amount that is disputed by the public entity."
"Existing law imposes specified requirements on an audit of pharmacy services provided to beneficiaries of a health benefit plan, and defines certain terms for its purposes, including, among others, pharmacy benefit manager.
This bill would exempt certain contracts governing the medicines and medical supplies that are required to be provided to injured employees in workers’ compensation cases from these requirements. The bill would also require a pharmacy benefit manager that reimburses a contracting pharmacy for a drug on a maximum allowable cost basis to include in a contract, initially entered into, or renewed on its scheduled renewal date, on or after January 1, 2016, information identifying any national drug pricing compendia or other data sources used to determine the maximum allowable cost for the drugs on a maximum allowable cost list and to provide for an appeal process for the contracting pharmacy, as specified. The bill would also require a pharmacy benefit manager to make available to a contracting pharmacy, upon request, the most up-to-date maximum allowable cost list or lists used by the pharmacy benefit manager for patients served by the pharmacy in a readily accessible, secure, and usable Web-based format or other comparable format. The bill would prohibit a drug from being included on a maximum allowable cost list or from being reimbursed on a maximum allowable cost basis unless certain requirements are met, including, but not limited to, that the drug is not obsolete.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2015. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to require a contract issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2013, between a pharmacy and a pharmacy benefit manager to provide pharmacy services to beneficiaries of a health benefit plan in a readily accessible, secure, and usable Web-based format under specified conditions. The bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager that reimburses a contracting pharmacy for a drug on a maximum allowable cost basis to include in a contract, initially entered into, or renewed on January 1, 2016, with the contracting pharmacy information identifying any national drug pricing compendia or other data sources used to determine the maximum allowable cost for the drugs on a maximum allowable cost list. A manager shall make available to a contracting pharmacy, upon request, the most up-to-date maximum allowable cost list or lists used by the manager for patients served in a readily accessible, secure, and usable Web-based format.

"Existing law authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control to regulate the disposal of hazardous waste, including used oil, and, for those purposes, defines “used oil” to mean oil that has been refined from crude oil, or any synthetic oil, that has been used, and, as a result of use or as a consequence of extended storage, or spillage, has been contaminated with physical or chemical impurities.
This bill would clarify that the synthetic oil referred to in the definition of “used oil” may be from any source.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code, with respect to the regulation of used oil, to specify that nothing in this Act authorizes the California Integrated Waste Management Board to exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste any used oil: (1) that meets the following requirements; (2) that is produced either solely from used oil or solely from recycled oil; (3) that has been mixed with hazardous waste; or (4) that is managed as a hazardous waste."
"The California Constitution requires Members of the Legislature, and all public officers and employees, to take and subscribe a specified oath of office or affirmation. The California Constitution permits inferior officers and employees to be exempted by law from this requirement. Existing law, in the case of particular officers, requires the oath, after being administered, to be filed in designated offices.
This bill would authorize a county board of supervisors to require a new oath or affirmation to be filed within 10 days of a legal change in name, delegated authority, or department by an officer or department head of that county. The bill would authorize the county to maintain a record, subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act, of each person so required to file a new oath of office, indicating whether or not the person has complied. The bill would specify that failure to comply with this requirement for a new oath or affirmation is not punishable as a crime. This bill would specify that the powers of an appointed officer of a county are no longer granted upon the officer’s departure from office, and would authorize a county board of supervisors to require the appointing authority to rescind these powers in writing by filing a revocation in the same manner as the oath of office was filed.
Existing law requires the oath or affirmation of disaster service workers to be filed in designated offices.
This bill would authorize a county board of supervisors to require a new oath or affirmation to be filed within 10 days of a change in legal name by a disaster service worker of that county. The bill would authorize the county to maintain a record, subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act, of each person so required to file a new oath of office, indicating whether or not the person has complied. The bill would specify that failure to comply with this requirement for a new oath or affirmation is not punishable as a crime.
Existing law requires the written appointment of a deputy of a county official to be filed as specified.
This bill would authorize a county board of supervisors to require a new appointment to be filed within 10 days of a legal change in name, delegated authority, or department by an appointed deputy of that county. The bill would authorize the county to maintain a record, subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act, of each person so required to file a new oath of office, indicating whether or not the person has complied.
Violating an oath or affirmation is a crime. Because this bill would expand the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Government Code, with respect to the oath of office for county office, to require that: (1) the oath of all officers whose authority is not limited to any particular county, in the office of the Secretary of State; (2) the oath of all officers elected or appointed for any county, and all officers whose duties are local or whose residence in any particular county is prescribed by law, be filed in the office of the county clerk of their respective counties; (3) each judge of a superior court, the county clerk, the clerk of the court, the executive officer or court administrator of the superior court, and the recorder file a copy of his or her official oath, signed with his or her own proper signature, in the office of the Secretary of State as soon as he or she has taken and subscribed his or her oath; and (4) the oath of all officers for any independent special district be filed in the office of the clerk or secretary of that district.

"Existing law provides for the regulation of secondhand dealers, as defined. Existing law makes it unlawful for a person to engage in the business of a secondhand dealer without a license issued by the chief of police, the sheriff, or, where appropriate, the police commission. Existing law requires a secondhand dealer or coin dealer, as defined, to report, as specified, to the chief of police or sheriff all secondhand “tangible personal property,” as defined, purchased, taken in trade, taken in pawn, accepted for sale on consignment, or accepted for auctioning. Existing law requires the report to include, among other things, the identification of the intended seller or pledger of the property, verified by the person taking the information by reasonably relying on specified documents, and a complete and reasonably accurate description of serialized property, including, but not limited to, the serial number of that property. A violation of these provisions where a person knows or should have known that a violation was being committed is a misdemeanor.
This bill would permit the person verifying the identification of the seller or pledger to use technology to obtain information and verify identity remotely. The bill would authorize specified unique identifying numbers to be used as the serial number reported for handheld electronic devices, as defined, and would require the report to the chief of police or sheriff to be updated within 10 days with these unique identifying numbers if they were not available when the report was submitted.
Because a violation of this requirement under certain circumstances would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Business and Professions Code, with respect to pawn dealers, to require a secondhand tangible personal property report submitted to the Department of Justice (DOJ) by each dealer to include the following: the intended seller or pledger of the property; the identification of the intended seller or pledger; and the identification of the intended seller or pledger.

Existing law provides that the decedent’s property, including property devised by a will, is generally subject to probate administration, except as specified.
AB 691 of the 2015–16 Regular Session would enact the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, which would authorize a decedent’s personal representative or trustee to access and manage digital assets and electronic communications, as specified. Among other provisions, AB 691 would provide that a custodian of digital assets, and its officers, employees, and agents, are immune from liability for an act or omission done in good faith and in compliance with the act.
This bill would specify that this immunity does not apply in a case of gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. The bill would become operative only if AB 691 is enacted prior to the enactment of this bill.
The Vacation Ownership and Time-share Act of 2004 requires all records of a time-share plan maintained by a time-share association to be made available for inspection and copying by any member for a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association. Existing law requires the time-share association to maintain among its records a complete list of the names and addresses of all owners of time-share interests in the time-share plan, as specified. Existing law prohibits an association from publishing the owners list or providing a copy of it to any time-share interest owner or to any 3rd party or using or selling the list for commercial purposes, except as provided in the time-share instruments.
This bill would require the owner addresses in the list to be mailing addresses, and would prohibit the association from publishing the list or providing a copy of it to any 3rd party or using or selling the list for commercial purposes. The bill would require the association to provide a copy of the list to an owner for a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association, except as specified. The bill would require, if a time-share interest owner makes a request to communicate by mail with the membership of the association for a purpose reasonably related to membership in the association, the communication to be made within 30 days of receipt of the request and payment of actual costs in performing the mailing. The bill would require, if the purpose is not reasonably related, the board of administration of the association or the managing entity to notify the requesting owner of the rejection. The bill would authorize a court to summarily order the distribution of the requested communication if it is not distributed within 30 days after receipt of a request from an owner and payment of actual costs. The bill would also specify that certain provisions of the Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law pertaining to the list of names, addresses, and voting rights of members of a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation do not apply to time-share associations under the Vacation Ownership and Time-share Act of 2004.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on June 22, 2015. (Sec. 1) This bill requires a custodian, within 60 days after receiving written information from the fiduciary or designated recipient of a time-share account, to comply with a request from such recipient to disclose digital assets or terminate an account. If the custodian fails to comply with a request, the fiduciary or designated recipient may apply to the court for an order directing compliance. The order shall contain a finding that disclosure is not in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. A custodian may: notify a user that a request for disclosure of digital assets or termination of an account was made pursuant to this bill, and may deny such a request if the custodian is aware of any lawful access to the account following the date of the user's death. A custodian may deny such a request if the custodian is aware of any lawful access to the account following the date of the user's death.

Existing law requires, as a condition of participation in a specified financial aid program, any report by a victim of a Part 1 violent crime, sexual assault, or hate crime, as defined, received by a campus security authority and made by the victim for purposes of notifying the institution or law enforcement, to be immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, disclosed to the appropriate local law enforcement agency without identifying the victim, unless the victim consents to being identified after the victim has been informed of his or her right to have his or her personally identifying information withheld. Existing law prohibits this report to a local law enforcement agency from identifying the alleged assailant if the victim does not consent to being identified.
This bill would authorize the identification of the alleged assailant, even if the victim does not consent to being identified, if the institution determines both that the alleged assailant represents a serious or ongoing threat to the safety of students, employees, or the institution, and that the immediate assistance of the local law enforcement agency is necessary to contact or detain the assailant. In that case, the bill would require the institution, as a condition of participation in the financial aid program, to disclose the identity of the alleged assailant to the local law enforcement agency and to immediately inform the victim of that disclosure.
This bill also would make conforming and nonsubstantive changes.","Requires the governing boards of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Directors of the Hastings College of the Law, the Regents of the University of California, and any postsecondary educational institution receiving public funds for student financial assistance to: (1) compile records at each campus within their respective jurisdictions of all occurrences reported to campus police, campus security personnel, or campus safety authorities of, and arrests for, crimes committed on campus that involve violence, hate violence, theft, destruction of property, illegal drugs, or alcohol intoxication; and (2) require any written record of a noncriminal act of hate violence to include a description of the act of hate violence, victim characteristics, and offender characteristics.

The bill would require taxicab transportation services and taxicab drivers to be subject to rules or regulations adopted by cities and counties as they existed on July 1, 2016, except for requirements specified in the bill that would apply to cities and counties, including charter cities and counties, other than the City and County of San Francisco. By imposing new duties on local governments, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would declare that its provisions are a matter of statewide concern and not a municipal affair. The bill would declare the intent of the Legislature that, among other things, regulation of taxicab transportation services shall be modernized and moved to one state agency.

4 months after the date letters testamentary or letters of administration are first issued to a personal representative with general powers.","This bill amends the Revenue and Taxation Code, as amended by the Internal Revenue Code, to require the transferee of real property, a manufactured home, or a floating home that is subject to local property taxation and is assessed by the county assessor to file a signed change in ownership statement. The statement must contain a notice informing the transferee of the property tax relief available under Section 69.5 of the Internal Revenue Code. The failure to file such a statement within 90 days after a written request is mailed by the assessor results in a penalty of either: (1) 100 dollars per day for failure to file, or (2) 10% of the taxes applicable to the new base year value reflecting a change in ownership of the property."
"Existing federal law provides for the federal Medicare Program, which is a public health insurance program for persons 65 years of age and older and specified persons with disabilities who are under 65 years of age.
Existing law authorizes a county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency that contracts for health care services, to contract with providers of health care services for care to local law enforcement patients. Existing law requires hospitals that do not contract with the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency that contracts for health care services to provide health care services to local law enforcement patients at a rate equal to 110% of the hospital’s actual costs according to the most recent Hospital Annual Financial Data report issued by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, as calculated using a cost-to-charge ratio.
This bill would authorize, for claims that have not previously been paid or otherwise determined by local law enforcement, those costs to be calculated according to the most recent approved cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program. The bill would authorize the hospital, with the approval of the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency responsible for providing health care services to local law enforcement patients, to choose which cost-to-charge ratio is most appropriate, and would require the hospital to give notice of any change. If the hospital chooses to use the cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program, the bill would require the hospital to attach supporting Medicare documentation and an expected payment calculation to the claim. If a claim does not contain that documentation and payment calculation, or if, within 60 days of the hospital’s request for approval to use the cost-to-charge ratio from the Medicare Program, approval is not granted by the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency responsible for providing health care services to local law enforcement patients, the bill would require the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development cost-to-charge ratio to be used to calculate the payment. The bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) Amends the California criminal code to authorize a county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency that contracts for health care services to contract with providers of health care services for care to local law enforcement patients. Allows hospitals that do not contract for health care services with the county sheriff police chief, or other public agency, to contract with providers of health care services for care to local law enforcement patients. Requires the hospital, with the approval of the county sheriff, police chief, or other public agency responsible for providing health care services to local law enforcement patients, to choose the most appropriate cost-to-charge ratio and to provide notice to such agencies of any change. Specifies that: (1) a county sheriff or police chief shall not request the release of an inmate from custody for the purpose of allowing the inmate to seek medical care at a hospital, and then immediately rearrest the individual upon discharge from the hospital, unless the hospital determines this action would enable it to bill and collect a third-party payment source; and (2) the California Hospital Statewide Association, the University of California, the California State Sheriffs Association, and"
"Existing law establishes the Department of Veterans Affairs and designates the Secretary of Veterans Affairs as the chief administrative officer of the department. Existing law also establishes the California Veterans Board, and requires the board to advise the department and secretary on policies for operations of the department. Existing law provides for veterans programs, including the veterans farm and home purchase programs, and provides for veterans homes.
This bill would create the office of Inspector General for Veterans Affairs, who would be subject to the direction of the Governor, within the department. The bill would require the inspector general to be appointed by the Governor, subject to Senate confirmation. The inspector general would be responsible for reviewing the operations and financial condition of each California veterans home, each veterans farm and home purchase program, and all other veterans programs supported by the state. Beginning January 1, 2017, and each year after, the bill would require the inspector general to submit a report to the board and the Legislature and make any recommendations he or she deems necessary for improving the operations of the veterans programs. The bill would repeal the reporting requirement on January 1, 2020.
The bill would authorize the inspector general to receive communications from any individual who believes he or she may have information that warrants a review or investigation of a veterans program. The bill would authorize, and in some instances require, the inspector general to conduct a review or investigation. The bill would also require the establishment of a toll-free telephone number to report alleged wrongdoing regarding veterans programs.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","This bill establishes the office of Inspector General for Veterans Affairs within the Department of Veterans Affairs in California. The inspector general shall be responsible for: reviewing the operations and financial condition of each California veterans home and veterans farm and home purchase program; reviewing the operation and financial condition of all other veterans programs supported by the state, including county veterans service offices and veterans memorials; and investigating allegations of department employee misconduct and reporting any findings of misconduct directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The inspector general may receive communications from individuals who believe they have information that warrants a review or investigation of a veterans program that is supported by the state. The inspector general shall establish a toll-free public telephone number for identifying any alleged wrongdoing regarding veterans programs."
"Existing law authorizes the board of supervisors to adopt, by resolution, a fee of up to $10 for each recording of a real estate instrument, paper, or notice required or permitted by law to be recorded, except as specified. Existing law defines the term “real estate instrument” to exclude a deed, instrument, or writing recorded in connection with a transfer subject to a documentary transfer tax.
This bill would recast this latter exclusion from a “real estate instrument” as a statement that the above-described fee does not apply to any real estate instrument, paper, or notice accompanied by a declaration stating that the transfer is subject to a documentary transfer tax, is recorded concurrently with a transfer subject to a documentary transfer tax, or is presented for recording within the same business day as, and is related to the recording of, a transfer subject to a documentary transfer tax.","Provides for the payment of a fee for the recording of every real estate instrument, paper, or notice required or permitted by law to be recorded in a California county, with fees paid quarterly to the county auditor or director of finance, to be placed in the Real Estate Fraud Prosecution Trust Fund. Declares that the fee shall not apply if: (1) the real estate instrument, paper, or notice is accompanied by a declaration that the transfer is subject to a documentary transfer tax; (2) such instrument, paper, or notice is recorded concurrently with a document subject to a documentary transfer tax; or (3) such instrument, paper, or notice is presented for recording within the same business day as, and is related to the recording of, a document subject to a documentary transfer tax. Requires that money placed in the Fund be expended to fund programs to enhance the capacity of local police and prosecutors to deter, investigate, and prosecute real estate fraud crimes."
"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including, among other services, home- and community-based services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions.
Existing law, until July 1, 2017, requires the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to establish a stakeholder workgroup, as prescribed, to develop a universal assessment process, including a universal assessment tool, to be used for home- and community-based services. No later than March 1, 2014, existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to report to the Legislature on the stakeholder workgroup’s progress in developing the universal assessment process and to identify the counties and beneficiary categories for which the universal assessment process may be implemented. No sooner than January 1, 2015, upon completion of the design and development of that universal assessment tool, existing law authorizes managed care health plans, counties, and other home- and community-based services providers to test the use of the tool for certain beneficiaries in no fewer than 2, and no more than 4, specified counties if certain conditions have been met. No later than 9 months after the implementation of the universal assessment process, existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging, to report to the Legislature on the results of the initial use of the universal assessment process.
This bill would extend the operation of these provisions until September 1, 2018. The bill would instead require the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to report to the Legislature on the stakeholder workgroup’s progress no later than December 1, 2016. The bill would instead require the State Department of Health Care Services, the State Department of Social Services, and the California Department of Aging to report to the Legislature on the results of the initial use of the universal assessment process no later than 15 months after the implementation of the universal assessment process. The bill would require this report to include, among other things, findings from consumers assessed using the universal assessment tool regarding their satisfaction of the universal assessment process.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to require the state of California to develop and test a universal assessment process for consumers that will inform the process and facilitate the development of plans of care based on the consumer's individual needs. Specifically, the process must: (1) be used for all home- and community-based services, including in-home and community-based assessment services (IHSS); and (2) include a universal assessment tool."
"(1) The California Constitution provides for the delegation to the Fish and Game Commission of powers relating to the protection and propagation of fish and game. Existing statutory law delegates to the commission the power to regulate the taking or possession of birds, mammals, fish, amphibia, and reptiles in accordance with prescribed laws. Under existing law, the Department of Fish and Wildlife exercises various functions with regard to the taking of fish and game. Under existing law, a city or county has no authority to regulate fish and game except that a city or county may adopt an ordinance that incidentally affects fishing and hunting for the protection of public health and safety.
This bill would provide that the state fully occupies the field of the taking and possession of fish and game. The bill would provide that unless otherwise authorized by the Fish and Game Code, other state law, or federal law, the commission and the department are the only entities that may adopt or promulgate regulations regarding the taking or possession of fish and game on any lands or waters within the state.
(2) Existing law requires the commission, when adopting certain regulations relating to the taking or possession of resident game birds, game mammals, and fur-bearing mammals, to consider populations, habitat, food supplies, the welfare of individual animals, and other pertinent facts and testimony.
This bill would require the commission to consider these factors when adopting certain regulations relating to the taking or possession of fish, amphibians, and reptiles. The bill would also require the commission to consider public health and safety when adopting these regulations.
(3)Existing law generally makes any violation of the Fish and Game Code or any rule, regulation, or order made or adopted under the code a misdemeanor, and specifies that a violation of designated statutes or regulations is either an infraction or a misdemeanor.
This bill would make a violation of a specified statute relating to the intentional discharge of a firearm or release of an arrow or crossbow bolt over or across a public road or other established way open to the public in an unsafe and reckless manner an infraction or a misdemeanor.
(3) Existing law makes it unlawful for a person to intentionally discharge a firearm or release an arrow or crossbow bolt over or across a public road or other established way open to the public in an unsafe and reckless manner. Existing law makes a violation of this provision a misdemeanor.
This bill would delete the “reckless” element from that provision. Because the bill would expand the definition of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Fish and Game Code to delegate to the California Fish and Game Commission the power to regulate the taking or possession of birds, mammals, fish, amphibia, and reptiles for purposes that include, but are not limited to, public health and safety. Declares that no power is delegated to the Commission to regulate the taking, possessing, processing, or use of fish, amphibia, fishing, or other aquatic plants for commercial purposes. Declares that it is the intent of the Legislature that local governments pursue requests for regulation of hunting, fishing, and depredation permits pursuant to this Code, and that the state fully owns, and occupies sole control over, the taking and possession of fish and game."
"Existing law subjects a person under 18 years of age who commits a crime to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge that person to be a ward of the court, except as specified. Under existing law, juvenile court proceedings to declare a minor a ward of the court are commenced by the filing of a petition by the probation officer, the district attorney after consultation with the probation officer, or the prosecuting attorney, as specified. Existing law requires the juvenile court to order the petition of a minor who is subject to the jurisdiction of the court dismissed if the minor satisfactorily completes a term of probation or an informal program of supervision, as specified, and requires the court to seal all records in the custody of the juvenile court pertaining to that dismissed petition, except as specified.
This bill would provide that these provisions do not apply if the petition was sustained based on the commission of certain offenses committed when the individual was 14 years of age or older. The bill would require records pertaining to those cases in the custody of law enforcement agencies, the probation department, or the Department of Justice to be sealed according to a certain procedure. The bill would authorize an individual who has a record that is eligible to be sealed to ask the court to order the sealing of a record pertaining to the case that is in the custody of a public agency other than a law enforcement agency, the probation department, or the Department of Justice. The bill would make records sealed pursuant to this provision available for access or inspection only under specified circumstances. The bill would make related changes. The bill would also require the Judicial Council to adopt rules of court, and make available appropriate forms, providing for the standardized implementation of these provisions by the juvenile courts. By imposing new duties on local agencies relating to sealing juvenile records, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law authorizes a person who is the subject of a juvenile court record, or the county probation officer, to petition the court for the sealing of the records relating to the person’s case, including records in the custody of the juvenile court, the probation officer, or any other agencies, including law enforcement agencies and public officials as the petitioner alleges to have custody of the records. Existing law provides that records sealed pursuant to this provision are not open to inspection, except as specified.
This bill would additionally make those records open to inspection to comply with data collection or data reporting requirements imposed by other provisions of law and would authorize a court to give a researcher or research organization access to information contained in those records, as specified.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
This bill would incorporate changes to Section 786 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and AB 989, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to require the court, if a minor satisfactorily completes an informal program of supervision or another term of probation and a petition for dismissal of the petition is ordered, to order sealed all records pertaining to that dismissed petition in the custody of the juvenile court, and in the custody of law enforcement agencies, the probation department, or the Department of Justice. Requires the court to send a copy of the order to each agency and official named in the order, direct the agency or official to seal its records, and specify a date by which the sealed records shall be destroyed. <n>Deems the satisfactory completion of such a program or another term of probation to have occurred if the person has no new findings of wardship or conviction for a felony offense or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude during the period of supervision or probation and has not failed to substantially comply with the reasonable orders of supervision or probation that are within his or her capacity to perform. Declares that: (1) an order or condition of restitution, including a restitution fine that can be converted to a civil judgment or an unpaid restitution fee shall not be deemed to constitute unsatisfactory completion of supervision or probation; and (2) a court shall not seal a record or dismiss a petition if the petition"
"Under existing law, the Corporate Securities Law of 1968, the Commissioner of Business Oversight regulates the activities of a broker-dealer which is defined as, among other things, any person engaged in the business of effecting securities transactions in California for the account of others or his or her own account, and it specifies those persons or entities excluded from the definition. Existing law requires, among other things, that a broker-dealer apply for and secure a certificate authorizing that person to act in that capacity, unless the person is exempted from this requirement, as prescribed. Existing law prohibits a person acting on behalf of a licensed broker-dealer or an issuer, from effecting any transaction in, or inducing or attempting to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state unless the broker-dealer and agent have complied with certain rules.
This bill would exempt from those provisions an individual who is a finder, as defined, who satisfies specified requirements, including, among other things, filing an initial statement of information with the Commissioner of Business Oversight and paying a filing fee.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)<n><n>(Sec. 1) This bill amends the securities laws of California to require that, for purposes of providing services to an issuer in a transaction involving securities that exceed a securities purchase price of 15 million dollars ($15 million in the aggregate), a finder shall: (1) obtain informed, informed consent of each person introduced, referred, and referred by the issuer; (2) participate in negotiating the terms of the offer or sale of the securities; (3) advise any party to the transaction regarding the value of the securities or the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling them; (4) conduct due diligence on the part of any party to the transaction; (5) sell or offer for sale in connection with the issuer transaction any securities of the issuer owned by the finder; (6) receive compensation in connection with any offer or sale of securities unless the sale is qualified under this division or unless the security or the transaction is exempt or not otherwise subject to qualification; and (7) make any disclosure to a potential purchaser other than the following: the issuer's name, address, and contact information; the name, type, price, and aggregate amount of any securities being offered"
"Existing law requires the county assessor to consider, when valuing real property for property taxation purposes, the effect of any enforceable restrictions to which the use of the land may be subjected. Under existing law these restrictions include, but are not limited to, zoning, recorded contracts with governmental agencies, and various other restrictions imposed by governments.
Existing property tax law establishes a welfare exemption under which property is exempt from taxation if, among other things, that property is used exclusively for religious, hospital, scientific, or charitable purposes and is owned and operated by an entity, as provided, that is itself organized and operated for those purposes. Under existing property tax law, the welfare exemption applies to property that is owned and operated by a nonprofit corporation, otherwise qualifying for the welfare exemption, that is organized and operated for the purpose of building and rehabilitating single-family or multifamily residences for sale, as provided, at cost to low-income families.
This bill would require the county assessor to consider, when valuing real property for property taxation purposes, a recorded contract with a nonprofit corporation that meets prescribed requirements, including requirements that the nonprofit corporation has received a welfare exemption for properties intended to be sold to low-income families who participate in a special no-interest loan program, and that the contract includes a restriction on the use of the land for at least 30 years to owner-occupied housing available at affordable housing cost. By changing the manner in which county assessors assess property for property taxation purposes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would incorporate amendments to Section 402.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code proposed by AB 1251, to be operative only if AB 1251 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to require, in the assessment of land, the assessor to consider the effect upon value of any enforceable restrictions to which the use of the land may be subjected, including: (1) zoning; (2) recorded contracts with governmental agencies other than those provided in specified provisions of the Code; (3) permit authority of, and permits issued by, governmental agencies exercising land use powers concurrently with local governments; (4) development controls of a local government in accordance with any local coastal program certified pursuant to Division 20 of the Public Resources Code; (5) development controls of a local government in accordance with a local protection program, or any component thereof; (6) environmental constraints applied to the use of land pursuant to provisions of statutes; (7) hazardous waste land use restriction; (8) a recorded conservation, trail, or scenic easement that is granted in favor of a public agency, or in favor of a nonprofit corporation organized pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code that has as its primary purpose the preservation, protection, or enhancement of land in its natural, scenic, historical, agricultural, forested, or open-space condition or use; and (9) a solar-use easement."
"(1) Existing law establishes, within the Government Operations Agency, the Department of Technology under the supervision of the Director of Technology, who is also known as the State Chief Information Officer. The department is generally responsible for the approval and oversight of information technology projects by, among other things, consulting with state agencies during initial project planning to ensure that project proposals are based on well-defined programmatic needs.
Existing law establishes, within the department, the Office of Information Security under the supervision of the Chief of the Office of Information Security. Existing law sets forth the authority of the office, including, but not limited to, the authority to conduct, or require to be conducted, an independent security assessment of any state agency, department, or office, the cost of which is to be funded by the state agency, department, or office being assessed.
This bill would additionally require the office, in consultation with the Office of Emergency Services, to require no fewer than 35 independent security assessments of state entities each year and determine basic standards of services to be performed as part of an independent security assessment. The bill would require the state agency, department, or office being assessed to fund the costs of its independent security assessment. The bill would require the office and the Office of Emergency Services to receive the complete results of an independent security assessment. The bill would prohibit, during the process of conducting an independent security assessment, the disclosure of information and records concerning the independent security assessment, except that the information and records would be authorized to be transmitted to state employees and state contractors with specific duties relating to the independent security assessment. The bill would require the disclosure of the results of a completed independent security assessment under state law.
This bill would require the office, in consultation with the Office of Emergency Services, to rank state entities on an information security risk index, as specified. The bill would require the office to report to the Department of Technology and the Office of Emergency Services any state entity found noncompliant with information security requirements. The bill would further require the office to notify the Office of Emergency Services, Department of the California Highway Patrol, and the Department of Justice of any criminal or alleged criminal cyber activity affecting any state entity or critical infrastructure of state government. The bill would authorize the office to conduct or require to be conducted an audit of information security to ensure program compliance, the cost of which to be funded by the state agency, department, or office being audited.
This bill would authorize the Military Department to perform an independent security assessment as described above.
This bill would require state entities, as defined, rather than certain information security officers, to comply with policies and procedures issued by the office. The bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes.
(2) Existing law requires that a statute that limits the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings to demonstrate the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would limit access to information and records of an ongoing independent security assessment and would make findings to demonstrate the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.","Requires the office established by this Act to: (1) determine criteria and rank state entities based on an information security risk index that may include, but not be limited to, analysis of the relative amount of the following factors within state agencies: Personally identifiable information protected by law; health information protected by law; confidential financial data; self-certification of compliance and indicators of unreported noncompliance with security provisions in specified areas; risk management; information asset management; technology recovery planning; and determinations of contractors who have been approved as necessary to receive the information and records to be performed as part of independent security assessments. Authorizes the Military Department to perform such an assessment. Requires the office to transmit the complete results of such assessment and recommendations for mitigating system vulnerabilities to the office and the Office of Emergency Services."
"Existing law requires a court to transfer the case of a person released on probation or mandatory supervision to the superior court in any other county in which the person resides permanently, unless the transferring court determines the transfer would be inappropriate and states its reasons on the record. Existing law requires the court of the receiving county to accept the entire jurisdiction over the case.
This bill would require the receiving court to accept the entire jurisdiction over the case effective the date the transferring court orders the transfer. The bill would provide that when fines, forfeitures, penalties, assessments, or restitution have been ordered by the transferring court and have not been fully paid, those payments would be made to the collecting program for the transferring court for distribution and accounting. The bill would authorize the receiving court and probation department to impose additional local fees and costs, as specified, and would authorize the collection program for the receiving court to collect court-ordered payments from the defendant for transmittal to the collection program for the transferring court, as specified. The bill would require the Judicial Council to consider adoption of rules of court as it deems appropriate to implement the collection, accounting, and disbursement requirements of the bill.","Directs the transferring court, if it has ordered the defendant to pay fines, fees, forfeitures, penalties, assessments, or restitution, the transfer order shall require that those and any other amounts ordered that are still unpaid at the time of transfer be paid by the defendant to the collection program for the transferring court for proper distribution and accounting once collected. Authorizes the receiving court and receiving county probation department to impose additional local fees and costs as authorized, and to notify the responsible collection program for the transferring court of those changes. Requires any such local fees imposed to be paid by the defendant to the collection program for the transferring court which shall remit the additional fees and costs to the receiving court for proper accounting and distribution. Authorizes a receiving court, upon approval of a transferring court, to elect to collect all of the court-ordered payments from the defendant attributable to the case under which the defendant is being supervised, provided that the collection program for the receiving court transmits the revenue collected to the collection program for the transferring court for deposit, accounting, and distribution. Prohibits a collection program for the receiving court from charging administrative fees for collections performed for the collection program for the transferring court without a written agreement with the other program. Requires the Judicial Council to consider adoption of rules"
"Existing law requires the State Board of Equalization to make surveys in each county and city and county to determine the adequacy of the procedures and practices employed by the county assessor in the valuation of property. Existing law requires the board to proceed with the surveys of the assessment procedures and practices in the several counties and cities and counties as rapidly as feasible, and to repeat or supplement each survey at least once in 5 years. Existing law requires the surveys of the 10 largest counties and cities and counties to include a sampling of assessments of the local assessment rolls, and requires the board, each year, to select at random at least 3 of the remaining counties or cities and counties to conduct a sample of assessments on the local assessment roll in those counties.
This bill would eliminate the board’s requirement to select at random at least 3 remaining counties or cities and counties to conduct a sample of assessments on the local assessment roll, and would instead require the board, commencing January 1, 2016, and each of the next 4 calendar years, to survey the assessment procedures of qualified counties or cities and counties and to conduct sample assessments on the local roll of other qualified counties or cities and counties. This bill would define “qualified counties or cities and counties” for these purposes. This bill would additionally require the board to conduct a sample of assessments in a county or city and county that the board determines has significant assessment problems, as specified. This bill would require the qualified counties and cities and counties to be stratified and selected at random by the board, in consultation with the California Assessors’ Association.
Existing law requires the board, upon completion of the survey of the procedures and practices of a county assessor, to prepare a written survey report setting forth its findings and recommendations, and requires the board, before preparing its written survey report, to meet with the assessor to discuss and confer on those matters which may be included in the written survey report. Existing law requires the survey report, together with the assessor’s response and the board’s comments, to constitute the final survey report. Existing law requires the final survey report to be issued by the board within 2 years after the date the board began the survey.
This bill would require the board, before preparing its written survey report, to notify the former assessor if the survey reviews the former assessor’s procedures and practices, and to also meet with the former assessor, upon his or her request if the survey reviews, to discuss and confer on those matters that may be included in the survey report. This bill would require an addendum to the final survey report to be published to include the former assessor’s written response and the board’s comments, if any. This bill would shorten the period of time the board has to issue the final survey report from 2 years to 15 months for any survey commenced on or after July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, inclusive, and to 12 months for any survey commenced on or after July 1, 2017.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2015.

"Existing law, the Visually Impaired Voter Assistance Act of 1989, requires the Secretary of State to establish a Visually Impaired Voter Assistance Board and prescribes the composition of the board, as specified. Under existing law the board is required to, among other things, make recommendations to the Secretary of State for improving the availability and accessibility of ballot pamphlet audio recordings and their delivery to visually impaired voters. Existing law also requires the Secretary of State to make available the complete state ballot pamphlet over the Internet, which is required to include specified information. Existing law further authorizes county and city elections officials to establish procedures designed to permit a voter to opt out of receiving his or her sample ballot, voter pamphlet, notice of polling place, and associated materials by mail, and instead obtain them electronically via email or by accessing them on the county’s or city’s Internet Web site, as specified.
This bill would rename the board as the Voting Accessibility Advisory Committee and would instead require the committee to advise the Secretary of State on improving the accessibility of elections, including election materials, as specified, for all voters with disabilities, and would revise the composition of the committee, as specified. The bill would require the Secretary of State to consult with the committee and consider the committee’s recommendations, which the Secretary of State could implement at his or her discretion. The bill would also require the committee to make additional recommendations to the Secretary of State for improving the accessibility of election materials made available over the Internet, and would require the elections materials made available over the Internet to meet or exceed certain standards and guidelines, as specified. The bill would further require the committee to make recommendations for providing voters with disabilities the same access and participation as is provided to other voters who are not disabled, including the ability to vote privately and independently.","Directs the Secretary of State to establish a Voting Accessibility Committee to promote accessibility of elections for voters with disabilities, including by: (1) establishing guidelines for reaching as many voters with disabilities as practical; (2) making recommendations for improving the availability and accessibility of election materials and public service announcements identifying the availability of election materials for voters with disabilities at least 45 days before any federal, state, and local election; (3) making recommendations for improving the accessibility of election materials made available on Internet sites that are in compliance with federal accessibility standards and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium; (4) promoting the Secretary to make information available to a toll-free voter registration telephone line for citizens needing voter registration information, including information for individuals with disabilities, and the California State Library and regional library services for individuals who are unable to read conventional print due to a visual, intellectual, learning, physical, or any other disability; (5) making recommendations for providing voters with disabilities the same access and participation as is provided to other voters who are not disabled, including the ability to vote privately and independently; (6) establishing subcommittees to further the scope and purposes of the Committee; and (7) establishing an Internet Web site, calculated and updated for each state ballot measure listed in the pamphlet, a means to access"
"Existing law establishes a regulatory scheme for the marketing of shell eggs, and requires egg producers and egg handlers to register with the Secretary of Food and Agriculture. A violation of those provisions or regulations adopted pursuant to those provisions is unlawful, and for certain violations, punishable as a misdemeanor. Existing law also authorizes the secretary, in lieu of seeking prosecution for the violation, to bring a civil action for up to $1,000 for the violation.
This bill would authorize the Department of Food and Agriculture to refuse to issue, or to suspend or revoke, an egg handler or egg producer certificate of registration under certain circumstances and would require the department to adopt regulations to establish procedures for an appeals process to contest the refusal to issue a certificate of registration or the department’s suspension or revocation of a certificate of registration. The bill would increase the civil penalty amount to $10,000 and would also authorize a county agricultural commissioner to bring a civil action. The bill would also authorize the secretary or a county agricultural commissioner, in lieu of prosecution, to levy an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 for a violation of those provisions. The bill would require the secretary, on or before January 1, 2017, to adopt regulations classifying violations of these egg provisions as either “minor,” “moderate,” or “serious,” with different penalty ranges applicable to each classification, as specified, and would apply these amounts to both civil penalties and administrative penalties. The bill would set forth notice and other procedural requirements for bringing and resolving an administrative action pursuant to those provisions, and would require the funds recovered by the county agricultural commissioner to be deposited in the county’s general fund, and funds collected by the secretary to be deposited into the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund for use by the department in administering these provisions, when appropriated to the department for that purpose.","This bill amends the Food and Agricultural Code to: (1) authorize the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to refuse to issue, or suspend or revoke, a certificate of registration for egg handlers or producers if either the applicant fails to pay a fine, fee, assessment, or penalty levied by USDA for a violation and the applicant has violated USDA regulations, or (2) authorize USDA to reverse the refusal to issue or suspension or revocation of a certificate of registration if it finds substantial grounds to do so. The bill also sets forth: (1) procedures for an appeals process, including a noticed hearing, for a person who wishes to contest USDA's refusal to issue a certificate of registration or to suspend or revoke it; and (2) the maximum period following a refusal to issue, suspension, or revocation of a certificate of registration. The bill authorizes USDA to impose: (1) civil monetary penalties for violations, and (2) administrative penalties for violations of the requirements contained in this bill."
"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing law provides that federally qualified health center services and rural health clinic services, as defined, are covered benefits under the Medi-Cal program, to be reimbursed, to the extent that federal financial participation is obtained, to providers on a per-visit basis. “Visit” is defined as a face-to-face encounter between a patient of a federally qualified health center or a rural health clinic and specified health care professionals.
This bill would include a marriage and family therapist within those health care professionals covered under that definition.","Makes federally qualified health center (FQHC) and rural health clinic (RHC) services covered benefits under title XIX (Medicaid) of the United States Code.Provides that, effective October 1, 2004, and each October 1, thereafter, until no longer required by Federal law, federally qualified health center (FQHC) and rural health clinic (RHC) per-visit rates shall be increased by the Medicare Economic Index applicable to primary care services in the manner provided for in specified provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code.Establishes conditions under which an FQHC or RHC may apply for an adjustment to its per-visit rate based on a change in the scope of services provided by the FQHC or RHC. Requires that rate changes based on a change in the scope of services provided by an FQHC or RHC be evaluated in accordance with Medicare reasonable cost principles."
"Existing law provides for the disposition of a testator’s property by will. Existing law also provides for the disposition of that portion of a decedent’s estate not disposed of by will. Existing law provides that the decedent’s property, including property devised by a will, is generally subject to probate administration, except as specified.
This bill would enact the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act, which would authorize a decedent’s personal representative or trustee to access and manage digital assets and electronic communications, as specified. The bill would authorize a person to use an online tool to give directions to the custodian of his or her digital assets regarding the disclosure of those assets. The bill would specify that, if a person has not used an online tool to give that direction, he or she may give direction regarding the disclosure of digital assets in a will, trust, power of attorney, or other record. The bill would require a custodian of the digital assets to comply with a fiduciary’s request for disclosure of digital assets or to terminate an account, except under certain circumstances, including when the decedent has prohibited this disclosure using the online tool. The bill would make custodians immune from liability for an act or omission done in good faith in compliance with these provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 5, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the state of California's Probate Code to establish a new Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act. Under the Act, courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over proceedings brought for the administration of a deceased user's estate through the use of an online tool that allows an individual to administer digital assets of the individual. The bill defines &quot;digital asset&quot; as an electronic record in which an individual has a right or interest, unless it is itself an electronic record."
"Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility, and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable.
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 establishes the State Air Resources Board as the state agency responsible for monitoring and regulating sources emitting greenhouse gases. That act requires the state board to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit, as defined, to be achieved by 2020, equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990. The state board is authorized to include market-based compliance mechanisms to comply with the regulations. The implementing regulations adopted by the state board provide for the direct allocation of greenhouse gas allowances to electrical corporations pursuant to a market-based compliance mechanism.
Existing law authorizes the commission to allocate 15% of these revenues for clean energy and energy efficiency projects established pursuant to statute that are administered by electrical corporations and requires the commission to direct the balance of the revenues to be credited directly to the residential, small business, and emissions-intensive trade-exposed retail customers of the electrical corporations, as specified.
This bill would authorize a qualified 3rd-party administrator to administer the clean energy and energy efficiency projects.
Existing law requires the commission to ensure that not less than 10% of the funds for the California Solar Initiative are utilized for the installation of solar energy systems, as defined, on low-income residential housing, as defined. Pursuant to this requirement, the commission adopted decisions that established the Single-Family Affordable Solar Homes Program and the Multifamily Affordable Solar Housing Program, pursuant to which the electrical corporations provide monetary incentives for the installation of solar energy systems on low-income residential housing.
This bill would require the commission to annually authorize the allocation of $100,000,000 or 10% of available funds, whichever is less, beginning with the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2016, and ending with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, from the greenhouse gas allowance revenues received by electrical corporations set aside for clean energy and energy efficiency projects for the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program, which the bill would create. The bill would require the commission to consider the most appropriate program administration, as specified, with not more than 10% of the allocated funds to be used for administration. The bill would require the commission to authorize, by June 30, 2017, the award of monetary incentives for solar energy systems, as defined, that are installed on qualified multifamily affordable housing properties, as defined, through December 31, 2030, with the target of the program being to install a combined generating capacity of at least 300 megawatts on qualified properties. The bill would require the commission to require that the electricity generated by qualifying solar energy systems installed on qualified multifamily affordable housing properties pursuant to the program be primarily used to offset electricity usage by low-income tenants. The bill would require that low-income tenants receive credits on utility bills from the program through tariffs that allow for the allocation of credits, as specified. The bill would require the commission, on or before July 30, 2020, and by July 30 of every third year thereafter through 2029, to submit an assessment, as specified, to the Legislature of the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program.
Existing law makes any public utility and any corporation or person other than a public utility that violates any part of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission guilty of a crime.
Because the provisions of this bill require action by the commission to implement its requirements, a violation of these commission-ordered requirements would impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to require revenues, including any accrued interest, received by an electrical corporation as a result of the direct allocation of greenhouse gas allowances to electric utilities to be credited directly to the residential, small business, and emissions-intensive trade-intensive retail customers of the corporation. (Requires the adoption and implementation of a customer outreach plan for each electrical corporation.) Directs FERC to allocate up to 15% of such revenues, including any accrued interest, received by an electrical corporation as a result of such direct allocation, to electrical distribution utilities for clean energy and energy efficiency projects administered by the electrical corporation or a qualified third-party administrator that are not otherwise funded by another funding source. Adds the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program to the list of activities for which FERC may allocate funds."
"The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the tax imposed by that law, including for a qualified renter, defined as an individual who rented and occupied premises in this state which constituted his or her principal place of residence during at least 50% of the taxable year, in a specified amount based on adjusted gross income, as provided.
This bill would allow, for each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2016, and before January 1, 2019, a credit in an amount equal to the increase in rent of a qualified residence in specified counties for the taxable year compared to the previous taxable year that is paid or incurred by a qualified taxpayer, which is defined as a senior citizen meeting a certain low-income requirements.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.
Existing law requires the replacement of plumbing fixtures that are not water conserving, as defined as noncompliant plumbing fixtures, in residential and commercial real property built and available for use on or before January 1, 1994, as specified.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.","Declares that it is a viable method to help low-income California senior renters remain in their homes. Allows, for each taxable year beginning on or January 1, 2016, and before January 1, 2019, a tax credit for the increase in rent of a qualified residence for the taxable year compared to the previous taxable year paid or incurred by a qualified taxpayer who is age 62 or older and who has rented such residence for 12 months on rent. Defines &quot;qualified residence&quot; as property located in San Francisco, Ventura, and Santa Clara Counties. Requires the replacement of all noncompliant plumbing fixtures in multifamily residential real property and in commercial real property with water-conserving plumbing fixtures required by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development."
"Existing federal law provides for the allocation of federal funds through the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant prould not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code, with respect to the California Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, to exclude unborn children, or recipients of aid under the program, from the determination of the family's income for purposes of payment of aid. Provides that, when the government increases or decreases its contributions in assistance of needy children in this State above or below the amount paid July 1972, the family's income shall be deducted from the sum specified in the following table, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases pursuant to this Act, and then calculated pursuant to this Act. Specifies that in no shall the amount of aid paid for each month exceed the sum specified in the following table, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases pursuant to this Act, plus any special needs, as specified in specified subdivisions and for the number of eligible needy persons in the same home aid program. Specifies that when the family does not include a needy child qualified under this Act, aid shall be paid to a pregnant woman who is first qualified for aid from a specified subdivision only when the woman and child is anticipated and for the six-month period in which delivery is anticipated and for the three-month period in which delivery is anticipated, if the woman and child would have qualified"
"Existing law establishes the California Land Conservation Act of 1965, otherwise known as the Williamson Act, and authorizes a city or county to enter into 10-year contracts with owners of land devoted to agricultural use, whereby the owners agree to continue using the property for that purpose, and the city or county agrees to value the land accordingly for purposes of property taxation, as specified. Existing law provides for the procedure to cancel a contract entered into under these provisions, and provides that the landowner and the Department of Conservation may agree on the cancellation value of the land.
This bill would require the department to provide a preliminary valuation of the land to the county assessor and the city council or board of supervisors at least 60 days prior to the effective date of the agreed upon cancellation valuation if the contract includes an additional cancellation fee, as specified.","Directs the assessor to determine the current fair market value of the land as if it were free of the contractual restriction. Permits the Department of Conservation or the landowner, also in a tentative cancellation petition, to provide information to assist the assessor in determining the value. Permits the assessor to recover the reasonable costs of the formal review from the party requesting the review, and to provide an estimate of those costs to the requesting party. Authorizes the assessor to require a deposit from the landowner to cover the contingency that payment of a cancellation fee will not necessarily result from the completion of a formal review. States that this Act shall not be construed as a limitation on the authority provided in specified provisions of the Government Code for cities or counties to recover their costs in the cancellation process, except that the assessor later must complete a formal review."
"Existing law, the Planning and Zoning Law, limits the amount of fees, charges, dedications, or other requirements levied or imposed by state and local agencies on the planning, use, or development of real property for the construction or reconstruction of school facilities based upon assessable space, as defined. In the case of residential construction, existing law defines assessable space to mean all of the square footage within the perimeter of a residential structure, not including any carport, walkway, garage, overhang, patio, enclosed patio, detached accessory structure, or similar area.
This bill would revise the definition of assessable space to specify that a covered or uncovered walkway is excluded.","Prohibits the imposition of any fee, charge, dedication, or other requirement for the construction or reconstruction of school facilities by any State, local, or other governmental agency, except for a fee, charge, dedication, or other requirement for residential construction or commercial or industrial construction, as defined by this Act. Limits the amount of such fees or requirements for residential construction, including the location installation or occupancy of manufactured homes and mobilehomes, as well as for commercial or industrial construction."
"Existing law requires a public, private, or independent postsecondary educational institution, except the California Community Colleges, to make specified disclosures related to private student loans in financial aid material and private loan applications provided or made available by the institution, to distinguish private loans from federal loans in individual financial aid awards, and, if the institution provides a private loan lender list, to provide general information about the loans available through the lender and disclose the basis for each lender’s inclusion on the list.
This bill would require the public, private, or independent institution, except the California Community Colleges, to make available to the public upon request and in a prominent location on its Internet Web site within 12 months of a completed academic year, as defined, specified student loan debt statistics on graduates. The bill would require all public, private, and independent postsecondary institutions to provide students information concerning unused state and federal financial assistance including unused federal student loan moneys available to them before certifying their eligibility for private student loans and, if the institution does not participate in federal student loan programs, to inform students that they may be eligible for federal student loans at participating institutions and provide them information regarding Cal Grants and federal student aid. The bill would make nonsubstantive and conforming changes.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Requires IHEs that provide a private loan lender list to provide general information about the loans available through the lender and disclose the basis for each lender inclusion on that list. Requires an IHE, if it provides a private loan lender list, to also disclose on its website, upon request, the number of students who started as first-time postsecondary students, received a certificate, associate's degree, or bachelor's degree during that academic year, and received federal loans during that academic year.

"(1) Existing law requires the Department of Housing and Community Development to allocate funds under the federal Community Development Block Grant Program to cities and counties. Existing law requires the department to determine and announce, in the applicable Notice of Funding Availability, the maximum amount of grant funds that may be used for economic development projects and programs, housing for persons and families of low or moderate income or for purposes directly related to the provision or improvement of housing opportunities for these persons and families, and for cities and counties that apply on behalf of certain Indian tribes. Existing law requires the department to develop and use certain eligibility criteria and requirements for certain economic development fund applications.
This bill would authorize the Department of Housing and Community Development to issue a Notice of Funding Availability under which the director of the department could determine that an applicant previously awarded funds is eligible to apply for, and receive, additional funds pursuant to the Community Development Block Grant Program, without regard to whether the applicant has expended at least a certain percentage of funds previously awarded.
(2) Existing law authorizes the Housing Finance Agency to issue revenue bonds for the purpose of financing the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, refinancing, or development of multifamily rental housing and for the provision of capital improvements in connection with, and determined necessary to, that multifamily rental housing. Existing law requires no less than 20%, or 15% for those multifamily rental housing developments located in a target area, as defined, of the total number of units in a multifamily rental housing development, financed or for which financing has been extended or committed from the proceeds of sale of each bond issuance of the agency, to be for occupancy on a priority basis by lower income households. Existing law further requires that not less than
1/2
of the units required for occupancy on a priority basis by lower income households be for occupancy on a priority basis for very low income households.
This bill would authorize the agency to waive the priority requirements for very low income households upon approval of the board and a specified determination.
Existing law prohibits rental payments on units required for occupancy by very low income households paid by persons occupying the units from exceeding 30% of 50% of the area median income, and sets forth occupancy assumptions for adjusting rents for household size, as specified.
This bill would, commencing September 1, 2016, authorize the agency to also utilize occupancy assumptions that it has determined are appropriate and commercially reasonable for financing extended pursuant to these provisions.
Existing law provides that the authorization to issue revenue bonds for these purposes constitutes an alternative method to issue bonds for making construction loans and mortgage loans for multifamily rental housing.
This bill would instead provide that the authorization to issue revenue bonds for these purposes constitutes an alternative method to finance construction loans and mortgage loans for multifamily rental housing.

The bill would require the district, by June 30, 2017, and at the end of every fiscal year thereafter, to transfer to the State Lands Commission specified amounts of the revenues generated on those granted tidelands and submerged lands, and would require the commission to allocate those revenues to the Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund and the Land Bank Fund for management of the commission’s granted lands program. By authorizing the deposit of additional moneys into a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation. The bill would require the commission, on or before July 1, 2019, to survey, monument, plat, and record or file with the Office of the County Recorder of the County of San Diego the area of tidelands and submerged lands granted pursuant to the bill. By imposing new duties on the district with regard to the management of, and accounting and transfer of funds from, those granted lands, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

"(1) Existing law establishes a system for the recordation of cattle brands and establishes various fees in connection with the recordation and the use of a brand, as specified. Existing law also establishes various inspection fees per cattle, as specified. Existing law requires these fees to be deposited in the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund, a continuously appropriated fund.
This bill would increase the inspection fees and other various fees in connection with the recordation and use of cattle brands. By increasing the amount of fees deposited in a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation.
(2) Existing law requires cattle to be inspected before being moved or transported under certain circumstances, including whenever cattle are sold.
This bill would exempt cattle that are being sold or whose ownership is being transferred from these inspection provisions if the individual or entity with a controlling interest in the cattle remains unchanged, if the cattle will not be moved out of state or out of a modified point-of-origin inspection area, and if the cattle are associated with either a registered brand or dairy exemption number. The bill would require, within 30 days of ownership transfer, all persons who have ownership in the cattle, including both the transferor and the transferee, to self-certify, under penalty of perjury, to the Department of Food and Agriculture as to their ownership in the cattle on a form prescribed by the department.

The bill would require an annexation to be subject to an agreement between the annexing city or county and the district board specifying the terms and conditions of annexation, and would delete the requirement for approval of annexation by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments. The bill would provide procedures for detachment of territory within the district by a specified supermajority vote of the district board and a majority vote of the governing body of the territory proposed to be detached.","This bill amends the Public Utilities Code to revise the boundaries of the East Bay Municipal Utility District.

This bill would require the Superintendent, by January 1, 2017, to recommend to the state board a schedule for the regular update of academic content standards in all subjects for which standards have been adopted by the state board in accordance with specified procedures, including the establishment of academic content standards advisory committees for those purposes and the recommendation of proposed updates by those committees to the state board.","This bill requires the Superintendent of Education to recommend to the California State Board of Education a schedule for the regular update of academic content standards in all subjects for which standards have been adopted by the state board. The schedule shall be aligned to the current eight-year cycle of curriculum framework updates and instructional materials adoptions. The state board shall determine whether those standards require an update based upon specified considerations, including the amount of time since the standards were adopted or last updated, whether additional research conducted since the standards were adopted or last updated justifies updates, and the potential impact on existing curriculum, instructional materials, and assessment systems. If the state board determines that an update to the academic content standards in a given subject is warranted, it shall convene an academic content standards advisory committee to recommend updates to the standards."
"Existing law, the Mental Health Services Act, an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, establishes the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission, and requires the commission to consist of 16 voting members, including, among others, two persons with a severe mental illness and a mental health professional, all appointed by the Governor. The act may be amended by the Legislature by a
2/3
vote of both houses and only so long as the amendment is consistent with and furthers the intent of the act. The Legislature may clarify procedures and terms of the act by majority vote.
The bill would require the Governor to appoint an additional member to the commission who has experience providing supportive housing to persons with a severe mental illness. The bill would state the findings and declarations of the Legislature that this change is consistent with and furthers the intent of the act.",This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to establish the Mental Health Services Oversight Commission to oversee the state mental health system and other specified programs under the Mental Health Services Act.
"(1) Existing law, the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority Act, until January 1, 2029, establishes the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority to raise and allocate resources for the restoration, enhancement, protection, and enjoyment of wetlands and wildlife habitat in the San Francisco Bay and along its shoreline. The act establishes a governing board of the authority composed of specified members, including a member who is a resident of the San Francisco Bay area with expertise in the implementation of the San Francisco Bay Conservancy Program, who serves as the chair. The act grants to the board all powers that are necessary to carry out the act, including, among other things, the power to levy specified benefit assessments, special taxes, and property-related fees, and to issue revenue bonds and general obligation bonds. However, the act limits the total amount of outstanding indebtedness incurred pursuant to those provisions authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds to 10% of the authority’s total revenues in the preceding fiscal year. Existing law generally requires a district to reimburse the county elections official for the actual costs incurred in conducting an election for the district. However, the act authorizes, until January 1, 2017, the authority to reimburse only the incremental costs, as defined, that are incurred by the county elections official related to submitting a special tax measure to the voters.
This bill would delete the requirement that one member of the board, who serves as the chair, be a resident of the San Francisco Bay area with expertise in the implementation of the San Francisco Bay Conservancy Program and would instead require that member to be an elected official of a bayside city or county, or an elected member of a special district, with expertise in the implementation of the San Francisco Bay Conservancy Program. The bill would also delete the limit on the authority’s total amount of outstanding general obligation bonded indebtedness and would, instead, prohibit the authority from having a total amount of outstanding bonded indebtedness that exceeds $1,500,000,000. The bill would specify that the authority may incur general obligation bonded indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of real property or for the funding or refunding of any outstanding bonded indebtness incurred by the authority. The bill would extend to January 1, 2019, the operation of the provision authorizing the authority to reimburse county elections officials for only the incremental costs of submitting a special tax measure to the voters, expanded to apply to other specified measures that would generate revenues for the authority. The bill would postpone to January 1, 2049, the repeal date for the act, and would make related conforming changes. By imposing additional duties on local government officials with regard to implementation of the act, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The act specifies that the special taxes are to be levied, and submitted to the voters, consistent with specified provisions of the California Constitution relating to voter approval for local tax levies and property-related fees, charges, and assessments.
This bill would instead specify that measures that will generate revenues are to be submitted to the voters, consistent with those requirements of the California Constitution and the requirements of the California Constitution relating to general obligation bond indebtedness and ad valorem taxes.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Exempts a benefit assessment, special tax, or property-related fee from such jurisdiction until December 31, 2048.<n>Authorizes the authority to: (1) levy a benefit assessment; (2) issue revenue bonds for such purposes; (3) apply for and receive grants from federal and state agencies; (4) solicit and accept gifts, fees, grants, and allocations from public and private entities; and (5) issue general obligations for the acquisition or improvement of real property or for funding or refunding of any outstanding indebtedness."
"Existing law, with respect to supplemental property tax assessments, specifies various limitation periods for assessments on the supplemental tax roll. Existing law provides for the application of property tax exemptions to those supplemental assessments provided, among other things, that an assessee file an exemption application within a specified time. Existing property tax law allows taxes, penalties, and interest imposed for late filings of property tax exemption applications for the supplemental roll that exceed $250 in total to be canceled or refunded up to 85% or 90%, as applicable, in the case of the exemption for a college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, or veterans’ organization.
This bill would expand this reduction to be applied to exemptions for public schools, as provided.
Existing property tax law provides, with respect to property as to which the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans’ organization, free public libraries, free museums, public schools, community colleges, state colleges, state universities, tribal housing, or welfare exemption was available but for which a timely application for exemption was not filed, that 90% of any tax or penalty or interest on that property shall be canceled or refunded if an appropriate application for exemption is filed on or before the lien date in the calendar year next succeeding the calendar year in which the exemption was not claimed by a timely application.
Existing property tax law requires, if an appropriate application for exemption is filed within 90 days from the first day of the month following the month in which the property was acquired or by February 15 of the following calendar year, whichever occurs first, any tax or penalty or interest imposed upon property owned by any organization qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans’ organization, tribal housing, or welfare exemption that is acquired by that organization during a given calendar year, after the lien date but before the first day of the fiscal year commencing within that calendar year, if the property is of a kind that would have been qualified for the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans’ organization, tribal housing, or welfare exemption if it had been owned by the organization on the lien date, to be canceled or refunded.
This bill would add public schools to the list of entities eligible for the cancellation or refund of any tax or penalty or interest imposed on property acquired in a given calendar year after the lien date but before the first day of the fiscal year commencing within that calendar year. The bill also would make conforming changes.
By increasing the duties of local officials relative to the administration of taxes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to repeal the income tax on supplemental assessments for certain exempt properties, including: (1) property for which the college, cemetery, church, religious, exhibition, veterans organization, public school, free public libraries, free museums, or welfare exemption was available; (2) property for which a veterans exemption was available but for which an application for exemption was not filed; (3) property for which a disabled veterans exemption was available but for which an application for exemption was not filed; and (4) property for which a change in ownership or new construction exemption is not in effect."
"Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to implement a plan that establishes reasonable child care standards and assigned reimbursement rates, as provided. Existing law requires the standard reimbursement rate to be increased annually by a cost-of-living adjustment, as provided.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.
This bill would provide that the standard reimbursement rate is not intended to fund mandated costs imposed upon child development programs due to actions of law relating to minimum wage requirements, health insurance requirements, new or increased fees, new or expanded program requirements, or other cost increases due to legislative action. The bill would also require the standard reimbursement rate to be raised as needed to provide a living wage, reasonable health insurance, and retirement benefits for employees, to support the recruitment and retention of skilled and trained teachers, to support the financial stability of programs and educational quality, and to achieve gender pay equity. The bill would define cost-of-living adjustment to be, among other things, at least equal to the amount of the inflation adjustments given to K–12 education programs, as provided.","Requires the Superintendent of the Department of Education to implement a plan that establishes reasonable standards and assigned reimbursement rates for state-funded child development programs, which vary with the length of the program year and the hours of service. Requires parent fees to be used to pay reasonable and necessary costs for providing additional services. Requires the reimbursement system to be submitted to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. Specifies the standard reimbursement rate for a 250-day year, and beginning with FY2015, which shall be increased by the cost-of-living adjustment granted by the Legislature pursuant to this Act. Requires the standard reimbursement rate to be raised as needed to provide a living wage, reasonable health insurance costs, new or expanded program requirements, or other cost increases due to legislative action. Directs that: (1) the plan provide for expansion of child development programs to reduce costs on an incremental basis to achieve the standard reimbursement rate, and (2) it provide for adjusting reimbursement on a case-by-case basis to maintain service levels for agencies currently at a rate less than 400 children."
"Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health, in cooperation with the State Department of Education, to establish a Public School Health Center Support Program to perform specified functions relating to the establishment, retention, or expansion of school health centers in California. Existing law, for purposes of those provisions, defines a “school health center” to mean a center or program located at or near a local educational agency that provides age-appropriate health care services at the program site or through referrals, and may conduct routine physical health, mental health, and oral health assessments. Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health, to the extent funds are appropriated to the department, to establish a grant program to provide technical assistance, and funding for the expansion, renovation, and retrofitting of existing school health centers, and the development of new school health centers, in accordance with specified procedures. Existing law requires the department to develop a request for proposal (RFP) process for collecting information on applicants, and determining which proposals shall receive grant funding, giving preference for grant funding to schools in areas designated as federally medically underserved areas or in areas with medically underserved populations, or schools with a high percentage of low-income and uninsured children and youth.
This bill would require the department to also give preference to schools with a high percentage of children and youth who receive free or low-cost health coverage through
Medi-Cal or Covered California.
Medi-Cal.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a grant program within the Public School Health Center Support Program to provide technical assistance, and funding for the expansion, renovation, and retrofitting of existing school health centers, and the development of new school health centers.

A school health center may receive grant funding if the school or school district does not employ a school nurse. However, it is not the intent of the Legislature that a school health center serve as a substitute"
"Existing law requires a person or entity that sells any quantity of specified substances to record the date of sale, product description, purchaser’s identification, and other specified information. Existing law requires the seller to retain this information for a period of 5 years and to present it upon demand by any law enforcement officer or authorized representative of the Attorney General. Existing law requires a person or entity that purchases any quantity of these specified substances to record the date of purchase, product description, and other specified information for a period of 3 years and to present it upon demand by any law enforcement officer or authorized representative of the Attorney General. A violation of these provisions is a crime.
This bill would add butane to the list of specified substances for which these requirements apply. The bill would also prohibit any person from purchasing more than 400 milliliters of butane in a calendar month. Because the bill would create a new crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Health and Safety Code to require manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, or other persons or entities who sell chlorofluorocarbons to a person in California or any other State to: (1) prepare a bill of sale that identifies the date of sale, cost of sale, method of payment, the specific items and quantities purchased and the proper purchaser identification information; (2) retain such information for five years; and (3) present such information upon demand by any law enforcement officer or authorized representative of the Attorney General.

"Existing law, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, authorizes a licensed winegrower or a licensed beer manufacturer to apply to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control for a certified farmers’ market sales permit, which allows, among others, the licensee to sell wine or beer at a certified farmers’ market, under specified conditions, and requires the licensee to pay a fee of $50 for the permit. Existing law requires a certified farmers’ market sales permit issued to a licensed winegrower, but not a licensed beer manufacturer, to allow an instructional tasting event on the subject of wine at a certified farmers’ market, under specified conditions. Existing law provides that moneys collected as fees pursuant to the act are to be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund. These moneys are generally allocated to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control upon appropriation by the Legislature.
This bill would also require a certified farmers’ market sales permit issued to a licensed beer manufacturer to allow an instructional tasting event on the subject of beer at a certified farmers’ market, under specified conditions.
Existing law authorizes specified nonprofit corporations that have not been issued a license authorizing the sale of wine to receive and possess wine donated to that nonprofit corporation, if the nonprofit corporation has submitted a license application to sell wine with the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.
This bill would additionally authorize those nonprofit corporations to receive and possess beer under the same circumstances.
Existing law authorizes the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to issue a special temporary on-sale or off-sale wine license to a nonprofit corporation that is exempt from payment of income taxes, subject to specified requirements and limitations.
This bill would extend this authorization to issue a special temporary on-sale or off-sale license to sell beer.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2010.

Existing law provides that the state shall not deny or interfere with a woman’s right to choose or obtain an abortion prior to viability of the fetus, as defined, or when necessary to protect her life or health. Existing law specifies the circumstances under which the performance of an abortion is deemed unauthorized.
This bill would enact the Reproductive FACT (Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care, and Transparency) Act, which would require a licensed covered facility, as defined, to disseminate a notice to all clients, as specified, stating, among other things, that California has public programs that provide immediate free or low-cost access to comprehensive family planning services, prenatal care, and abortion, for eligible women. The bill would also require an unlicensed covered facility, as defined, to disseminate a notice to all clients, as specified, stating, among other things, that the facility is not licensed as a medical facility by the State of California.
The bill would authorize the Attorney General, city attorney, or county counsel to bring an action to impose a specified civil penalty against covered facilities that fail to comply with these requirements.","Amends the Health and Safety Code to require a licensed primary care clinic that is enrolled as a Medi-Cal provider and a provider in the Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment Program to disseminate to clients on site the following notice in English and in the primary threshold languages for Medi-Cal beneficiaries: (1) the facility offers obstetric ultrasounds, sonograms, or prenatal care to pregnant women; (2) the facility offers pregnancy testing or diagnosis; (3) the facility offers pregnancy testing or pregnancy diagnosis; (4) the facility advertises or solicits patrons with offers to provide prenatal sonography, pregnancy tests, or pregnancy options counseling; and (5) the facility offers abortion services.

(2) The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act authorizes a licensed winegrower to apply to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control for a wine sales event permit that allows the sale of bottled wine produced by that winegrower at specified events approved by the department. The act prohibits a wine sales event permit from being used more than 2 times a month at a particular location, and requires the winegrower to pay a fee of $50 for the permit. The act provides that moneys collected as fees pursuant to the act are to be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund. These moneys are generally allocated to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control upon appropriation by the Legislature.
This bill would authorize a licensed beer manufacturer to apply to the department for a brewery event permit that allows the sale of beer produced by that beer manufacturer for consumption on property contiguous and adjacent to the licensed premises of the manufacturer, as provided. The bill would authorize a fee for a brewery event permit of $110 for the 2016 calendar year, and thereafter as provided, and an event authorization fee of not more than $25 for each approved event. The bill would allow up to 4 authorized events each calendar year.

Existing law specifies that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act does not prohibit holders of retail on-sale or off-sale licenses from purchasing advertising in any publication by specified alcoholic beverage licensees.
This bill would specify that the act does not prohibit purchasing advertising in a publication published by a nonretail licensee, as defined, and would include Internet Web sites and social media feeds as types of publications for these purposes.
(4) The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act authorizes specified licensees to purchase alcoholic beverages for resale under specified circumstances. The act provides that a person convicted of a violation of its provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor unless another penalty or punishment is specifically provided.

By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(5) Existing law requires the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, in any hearing on an accusation charging a licensee with a violation of specified provisions relating to minors, to produce the alleged minor for examination at the hearing unless he or she is unavailable as a witness because he or she is dead or unable to attend the hearing because of a then-existing physical or mental illness or infirmity, or unless the licensee has waived, in writing, the appearance of the minor. Existing law provides that when a minor is absent because of a then-existing physical or mental illness or infirmity, a reasonable continuance shall be granted to allow for the appearance of the minor if the administrative law judge finds that it is reasonably likely that the minor can be produced within a reasonable amount of time.

"The Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act governs the management and operation of common interest developments. Existing law provides that, unless otherwise provided in the common interest development declaration, the association is responsible for repairing, replacing, or maintaining the common area, other than exclusive use common area, and the owner of each separate interest is responsible for maintaining that separate interest and any exclusive use common area appurtenant to that interest. Existing law makes void and unenforceable any provision of the governing documents or architectural or landscaping guidelines or policies that prohibits use of low water-using plants, or prohibits or restricts compliance with water-efficient landscape ordinances or regulations on the use of water, as specified.
Existing law also prohibits an association, except an association that uses recycled water for landscape irrigation, from imposing a fine or assessment on separate interest owners for reducing or eliminating watering of vegetation or lawns during any period for which the Governor has declared a state of emergency or the local government has declared a local emergency due to drought.
This bill would revise that exception to instead authorize the imposition of a fine or assessment against the owner of a separate interest that receives recycled water from a retail water supplier, as defined, and fails to use that recycled water for landscaping irrigation.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 4735 of the Civil Code proposed by AB 349 that would become operative if this bill and AB 349 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.

"Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, establishes the California State Board of Pharmacy and sets forth its powers and duties, including, but not limited to, the licensing and regulation of pharmacists. Existing law makes a knowing violation of these provisions a crime.
Existing law requires every prescription, as defined, to include a legible, clear notice of the condition or purpose for which the drug is prescribed, if requested by the patient. Existing law prohibits a pharmacist from dispensing any prescription unless it is in a specified container that is correctly labeled to include, among other information, the condition or purpose for which the drug was prescribed, if the condition or purpose is indicated on the prescription.
This bill would instead require that every prescription include a legible, clear notice of the condition or purpose for which the drug is prescribed, and would authorize the prescriber or patient to request that this information not be included in the prescription container label. This bill would, similarly, require that every prescription container be correctly labeled to include that information, unless omission of that information has been requested by the prescriber or patient.
By establishing these additional requirements, the knowing violation of which would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, requires an oral or an electronic data transmission prescription to be reduced to writing by the pharmacist and to be filled by, or under the direction of, the pharmacist. Under existing law, the pharmacist does not need to reduce to writing the address, telephone number, license classification, federal registry number of the prescriber or the address of the patient or patients if the information is readily retrievable in the pharmacy.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on March 19, 2003.

This bill would delete the sunset date, thereby extending the operation of these provisions indefinitely. By extending the operation of these provisions, the violation of which by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

The bill would create the Open Educational Resources Adoption Incentive Program to provide incentives and reward campus, staff, and faculty efforts to accelerate the adoption of open educational resources. The bill would require that specified moneys for the program be used by campuses to create and support faculty and staff professional development, open educational resource curation activities, curriculum modification, or technology support for faculty, staff, and students, as specified. The bill would authorize the local academic senate of a campus of the California State University or the California Community Colleges to (A) adopt a local campus resolution to increase student access to high-quality open educational resources and reduce the cost of textbooks and supplies for students, and (B) upon adoption of the resolution, develop a specified plan, in collaboration with students and the administration, that describes evidence of the campus’ commitment and readiness to spend grant money from the fund to support faculty adoption of open educational resources. The bill would require the California Open Education Resources Council to review and approve the plan, and, if it meets these and other specified requirements, would authorize the Chancellor of the California State University to award an initial grant of up to $50,000 to the campus from the fund. The bill would require additional bonus grants to be distributed to participating campuses if certain benchmarks are met. The bill would cap the number of initial grants that may be approved by the California Open Education Resources Council each award year at 100. The bill would require the California Digital Open Source Library, also known as the California Open Online Library for Education, in consultation with the Intersegmental Committee of Academic Senates, to report to the Legislature before September 1 of each year, commencing in 2018, as to whether the grants are increasing the rate of adoption of open educational resources and decreasing textbook costs for college students.
The bill would make these provisions inoperative on September 1, 2020, and would repeal them as of January 1, 2021.
(2) Existing law appropriates, from specified funds, $5,000,000 to the Chancellor of the California State University to fund, among other things, the establishment and administration of the California Open Education Resources Council and the California Digital Open Source Library.

This bill would exempt a limited liability company that is a qualified investment partnership, as defined, from that annual tax and fee by excluding it from the definition of a limited liability company. The bill would require that entity to submit a return under the conditions applicable to a partnership.

"Existing law defines a transfer fee as a fee payment requirement imposed in any covenant, restriction, or condition contained in any deed, contract, security instrument, or other document affecting the transfer or sale of real property that requires a fee be paid upon transfer of the real property, with specified exceptions. Existing law, with regard to a transfer fee imposed upon real property on or after January 1, 2008, requires the person or entity imposing the transfer fee, as a condition of payment of the fee, to record a specified document describing the transfer fee concurrently with the instrument creating the transfer fee requirement. Existing law requires these recorded documents to include information on the amount of the fee and actual dollar examples of the fee for a residential property, among other things. Existing law requires a transferor of residential real property subject to transfer fees to make a specified disclosure regarding those fees.
This bill would specify that the required information on the recorded document include the method for calculating the amount of the transfer fee, if not a flat amount or a percentage of the sales price, and include the actual dollar examples of the fee for a residential property if the amount of the fee is based on the price of the real property. The bill would also require the transferor of residential real property subject to transfer fees to make the specified disclosure regarding those fees if the recorded document describing the transfer fees has not already been provided. The bill would also clarify the definition of a transfer fee.
Existing law excludes from the definition of a transfer fee any fee reflected in a document recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2007, that is separate from any covenants, conditions, and restrictions, and that provides a prospective transferee notice of specified information, including the amount or method of calculation of the fee.
This bill would specify that the information shall be set forth in a single document and may not be incorporated by reference from any other document.
This bill would provide that a fee reflected in a document recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2007, that is not separate from any covenants, conditions, and restrictions, or that incorporates by reference from another document, constitutes a transfer fee for the purposes of requirements relating to these fees. The bill would make unenforceable a transfer fee recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2007, that complies with the provisions described above and that incorporates by reference from another document unless it is recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2016, in a single document that complies with the provisions described above.

"Existing law requires the State Department of Education, with the approval of the State Board of Education, to establish procedures for conducting an assessment of pupils who are English learners in order to determine the level of English proficiency. Existing law requires each school district that has one or more pupils who are English learners, to assess the English language development of each pupil. Existing law requires this assessment to be conducted upon initial enrollment, and annually thereafter, during a period determined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the state board.
This bill would, notwithstanding the above provisions, require the department, on or before September 1, 2017, to develop an assessment tool to determine the proficiency level of pupils of limited academic English proficiency, as defined, and as determined by a formal process that the bill would require the Superintendent to develop in consultation with the department and local educational agencies, as provided. The bill would require the assessment to be conducted upon a pupil’s initial enrollment or as early as possible after enrollment, in order to provide information to determine if the pupil is a pupil of limited academic English proficiency, and annually thereafter, during a period of time determined by the Superintendent and the state board. The bill would require the annual assessments to continue until the pupil is designated as academic English proficient, as provided. The bill would require, if a pupil is still performing at a level of limited academic English proficiency after the grade 8 Smarter Balanced Assessment System summative and interim assessments, the school district to provide targeted resources with the goal of the pupil scoring at the level of 3 or higher on the grade 11 Smarter Balanced Assessment System summative and interim assessments.
By creating new duties for a local educational agency, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would, contingent on the enactment of an appropriation in the annual Budget Act or related legislation for the purpose of implementing these provisions, require the Los Angeles Unified School District, in partnership with the University of California, Los Angeles Center X, to conduct an evaluation of the Los Angeles Unified School District’s Academic English Mastery Program, as specified. The bill would require the evaluation to be completed by an unspecified date and submitted to the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the Legislature. To the extent the bill would impose additional duties on the Los Angeles Unified School District, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 14, 2016.

The bill would also require these agencies, upon a joint determination by the agencies that a need exists to improve cost-effective services to taxpayers and an appropriation by the Legislature, to consolidate forms, applications, and other documents to reduce or eliminate the number of multiple submissions of the same information by taxpayers.
Under existing law, whenever an amount of money paid by a person to the state includes a sum that can be identified as intended as payment of a locally administered tax that should have been paid directly to a local government within the state, the state is authorized to pay the amount to the local government and notify the payor of its action. However, existing law prohibits this procedure from being followed unless the governing body of the local government has, by resolution, agreed with respect to those payments that a timely payment received by the state will be regarded as a timely payment to the local government concerned, as provided.

The bill requires: (1) the Franchise Tax Board to consider the California Tax Service Center website in its budget justification; and (2) the Board and the Employment Development Department to submit to the Legislature, within six months after the study is completed, a feasibility study regarding the consolidation of the tax agencies."
"(1) The Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act generally requires the administrator for oil spill response, acting at the direction of the Governor, to implement activities relating to oil spill response, including emergency drills and preparedness, and oil spill containment and cleanup, and to represent the state in any coordinated response efforts with the federal government.
The act imposes an oil spill prevention and administration fee in an amount determined by the administrator to be sufficient to implement oil spill prevention activities, but not to exceed $0.065 per barrel of crude oil or petroleum products, and to be remitted to the State Board of Equalization. The act requires the oil spill prevention and administration fee to be imposed upon a person owning crude oil or petroleum products at the time that the crude oil or petroleum products are received at a marine terminal or refinery by specified modes of delivery from within or outside the state, as specified. The act prohibits the fee from being collected by a marine terminal operator or refinery operator or imposed on the owner of crude oil or petroleum products if the fee has been previously collected or paid on the crude oil or petroleum products at another marine terminal or refinery and, in that case, requires a marine terminal operator, refinery operator, or owner of crude oil or petroleum products to demonstrate that the fee has already been paid.
This bill instead would authorize a marine terminal operator or a refinery operator receiving petroleum products derived from crude oil refined in the state to presume the fee has been previously collected. The bill would also no longer require the owner of the crude oil or petroleum products to remit the fee to the board. The bill would make conforming changes.
This bill would state the intent of the Legislature that the board collect the oil spill prevention and administration fee only upon first delivery to a refinery or marine terminal and not upon the subsequent movement of that same crude oil or petroleum products following that first delivery.
(2) Existing law requires every person who operates a refinery in this state, a marine terminal in waters of the state, or a pipeline to transport crude oil or petroleum products out of the state to register with the board. Existing law defines, for the purposes of the board’s administration of those provisions, certain terms, including, among others, oil.
This bill instead would require every person who operates a refinery in this state, a marine terminal in waters of the state, or a pipeline to transport crude oil out of the state or petroleum products into the state to register with the board for the purposes of the oil spill prevention and administration fee and the uniform oil spill response fee, as applicable. The bill would delete the definition of oil, and would define barrel to mean 42 gallons of crude oil or petroleum products for these purposes.","This bill amends the Government Code to require the State Board of Equalization to collect an oil spill prevention and administration fee of between six and one-half cents per barrel of crude oil or petroleum products, based on each barrel of crude oil or petroleum products received at a marine terminal or a refinery within the state.

Existing law specifies the amounts of the maximum Cal Grant A and B awards for students attending private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions and private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions that are regionally accredited, as specified.
This bill would change, in accordance with a prescribed formula, the maximum Cal Grant awards for students attending private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions, commencing with the 2015–16 award year. The bill would impose requirements on private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions to provide specified data to a specified association as a condition for the funding of Cal Grant maximum awards to their students, and would require the association to report on that information to the Legislature, the Governor, the Department of Finance, and the Legislative Analyst’s Office.

The bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating additional crimes.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

"Existing law, the California Community Care Facilities Act, provides for the licensing and regulation of community care facilities, as defined, by the State Department of Social Services. A violation of the act is a misdemeanor. Existing law exempts recovery houses providing group living arrangements for persons recovering from alcoholism or drug addiction from the act.
This bill would require a recovery house that is owned or operated, as defined, by a community care facility licensed pursuant to the act and that functions as an integral component of that community care facility to be deemed a facility that provides treatment or services under the license of the community care facility. The bill would subject a facility under that license to the inspection and enforcement provisions of the act.
Because this bill would extend the application of a crime under these provisions, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2010. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

"The State Civil Service Act generally requires the workweek of state employees to be 40 hours, and the workday of state employees to be 8 hours. Under the act, it is the policy of the state to avoid the necessity for overtime work whenever possible.
This bill, commencing January 1, 2019, would prohibit a nurse or Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), as defined, employed by the State of California in a specified type of facility from being compelled to work in excess of the regularly scheduled workweek or work shift, except under certain circumstances. The bill would authorize a nurse or CNA to volunteer or agree to work hours in addition to his or her regularly scheduled workweek or work shift, but the refusal to accept those additional hours would not constitute patient abandonment or neglect or be grounds for discrimination, dismissal, discharge, or any other penalty or employment decision adverse to the nurse or CNA.
This bill would require such a facility to establish a 8-member joint labor management task force, with membership as prescribed, to meet quarterly to develop specific recommendations and a plan to reduce or eliminate mandatory overtime. The bill would require a task force, on or before November 1, 2018, to prepare and submit to the Legislature a report on its recommendations. Those task force and report provisions would be repealed on January 1, 2019.
The bill would make a related statement of legislative intent.","(Sec. 1) This bill expresses the intent of the Legislature to ensure that there is a process in a state health care facility to avoid on-the-spot mandatory overtime of any nurse or certified nursing assistant whose regularly scheduled work shift is complete, and to prevent circumstances where an employee is stopped at the gate of, for example, a Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and California Correctional Health Care Services facility and is instructed to return to work at the end of the employee's regularly scheduled work shift. It is the intent of the Legislature to prohibit a state facility that employs nurses or CNAs from using mandatory overtime as a scheduling tool or as an excuse for fulfilling an operational need that results from a management failure to properly staff those state facilities. The bill prohibits a facility from requiring a nurse or CNA to work in excess of a regularly scheduled workweek or work shift. A nurse or CNA may volunteer or agree to work hours in addition to his or her regularly scheduled workweek or work shift, but the refusal by a nurse or CNA to accept those additional hours shall not constitute: grounds for discrimination, dismissal, discharge, or any other penalty or employment decision adverse to the nurse or CNA, except under circumstances provided for in the Nursing Practice Act; or patient abandonment or neglect, except"
"Existing law prohibits a foreign corporation from transacting intrastate business without a certificate of qualification from the Secretary of State, and requires a statement filed for a certificate of qualification to include, among other things, an agent for service of process within the state. Existing law prohibits a foreign limited liability company transacting intrastate business in this state from maintaining an action or proceeding in this state unless it has a certificate of registration filed with the Secretary of State, and requires an application for a certificate of registration to include, among other things, an agent for service of process.
This bill would specify that a foreign corporation and foreign limited liability company may consent to service of process for a search warrant by email or submission to a designated Internet Web portal.","Amends the Corporations Code to prohibit a foreign corporation from transacting intrastate business without having first obtained a certificate of qualification from the Secretary of State. Requires a foreign corporation, to obtain such certificate, to file with the Secretary a statement and designation signed by a corporate officer or, in the case of a foreign association that has no officers, signed by a trustee stating: (1) its name and the state or place of its incorporation or organization; (2) the street address of its principal executive office; (3) the mailing address of its principal executive office; (4) the name of an agent upon whom process directed to the agent may be served within California; and (5) its irrevocable consent to service of process on such agent, if any. Applies this Act to a foreign corporation that is a party or a nonparty to the matter for which the search warrant is sought."
"Existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services to license adult alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facilities, as defined. Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health care practitioners by various boards and other entities within the Department of Consumer Affairs, and prescribes the scope of practice of those health care practitioners.
This bill would authorize an adult alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facility that is licensed under those provisions to allow a licensed physician and surgeon or other health care practitioner, as defined, to provide incidental medical services, as defined, to a resident of the facility at the facility premises under specified limited circumstances, including, among others, that the resident signs an admission agreement and a physician and surgeon or other health care practitioner determines that it is medically appropriate for the resident to receive these services. The bill would require the department to establish and collect an additional fee from those facilities, in an amount sufficient to cover the department’s reasonable costs of regulating the provision of those services. The bill would require the department, on or before July 1, 2018, to adopt regulations to implement its provisions. The bill would also make related findings and declarations.","This bill requires a licensed residential treatment facility to obtain a signed certification from each program participant from a health care practitioner as a condition for providing incidental medical services, which are services that are in compliance with the community standard of practice and are not required to be performed in a licensed clinic or licensed health facility to address medical issues associated with either detoxification from alcohol or drugs or the provision of alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment services. Incidental medical services do not include the provision of general primary medical care. A licensed alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facility may permit incidental medical services to be provided to a resident at the facility premises by, or under the supervision of, one or more physicians and surgeons licensed by the Medical Board of California or the Osteopathic Medical Board who are knowledgeable about addiction medicine."
"Under existing law, except as specified, a person is liable for physical invasion of privacy when that person knowingly enters onto the land of another person without permission or otherwise trespasses to capture any type of visual image, sound recording, or other physical impression of a person engaging in a private, personal, or familial activity and the invasion occurs in a manner that is offensive to a reasonable person. Under existing law, a person is liable for constructive invasion of privacy for the same activity, as specified, through the use of any device, regardless of whether there is a physical trespass. Existing law subjects a person who commits physical or constructive invasion of privacy to specified damages and civil fines.
This bill would expand liability for physical invasion of privacy to additionally include a person knowingly entering into the airspace above the land of another person without permission, as provided.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Civil Code to make a person liable for physical invasion of privacy when the person knowingly enters onto the land or into the airspace above the land of another person without permission or otherwise commits a trespass in order to capture any type of visual image, sound recording, or other physical impression of the plaintiff engaging in a private, personal, or familial activity and the invasion occurs in a manner that is offensive to a reasonable person. Makes a person liable for constructive invasion of privacy when the person attempts to capture such an impression through the use of any device, regardless of whether there is a physical trespass, if such image, sound recording, or other physical impression could not have been achieved without a trespass unless the device was used. Makes a person liable for an assault or false imprisonment committed with the intent to capture such an impression. Specifies that a person who commits any such act shall be liable for up to three times the amount of any general and special damages proximately caused by the violation and may be subject to punitive damages if the plaintiff proves that the invasion of privacy was committed for a commercial purpose.

"(1) Existing law authorizes the Department of Food and Agriculture, with the prior approval of the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the State Department of Health Care Services, to reproduce or distribute biological control organisms that are not detrimental to the public health and safety that are known to be useful in reducing or preventing plant or animal damage due to pests or diseases.
This bill would substitute the State Department of Public Health for the State Department of Health Care Services in these provisions.
(2) Existing law authorizes the Department of Food and Agriculture, by rule or regulation, to provide for the issuance and renewal on a 2-year basis of licenses, certificates of registration, or other indicia of authority issued pursuant to the Food and Agricultural Code by the department or any agency in the department, and to set the fees for the issuance or renewal of those licenses, certificates of registration, or other indicia.
This bill would instead specify that those licenses, certificates of registration, or other indicia of authority issued pursuant to the Food and Agricultural Code are those issued by the department or any division, office, or other entity within the department.
(3) Existing law specifies that it is the intent of the Legislature that the department, in cooperation with appropriate county officials and industry representatives, develop mutually satisfactory sources of nonstate funding to augment budget programs in the areas of county agricultural commissioners and weights and measures.
This bill would clarify that provision to specify that it is the intent of the Legislature that the department develop mutually satisfactory sources of nonstate funding to augment budget programs in the areas of county agricultural commissioners and county sealers of weights and measures.
(4) Under existing law, certified farmers’ markets are California agricultural product point-of-sale locations that are registered and operated in accordance with specified provisions. Existing law requires an operator of a certified farmers’ market to establish a clearly defined marketing area where only agricultural products may be sold. Existing law prohibits an operator of a certified farmers’ market that also operates, manages, or otherwise controls a separate sales activity or vending event or marketing area in close proximity, adjacent, or contiguous to the operator’s certified farmers’ market from allowing the sale or distribution of fresh whole fruits, nuts, vegetables, and flowers by vendors selling within those sales activity or vending event or marketing areas. Under existing law, a violation of these provisions is an infraction or misdemeanor, as specified.
This bill would add cultivated mushrooms and herbs to the list of items that an operator of a certified farmers’ market that also operates, manages, or otherwise controls a separate sales activity or vending event or marketing area in close proximity, adjacent, or contiguous to the operator’s certified farmers’ market is prohibited from selling within those sales activity or vending event or marketing areas. By changing the definition of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires a certified farmers’ market operator or producer to annually register with the Department of Food and Agriculture by applying for and receiving a certificate from a county agricultural commissioner. Existing law requires a producer farming fruit, vegetables, nuts, herbs, and similar crops, once certified, to annually submit information requested by the department about the specific crops that the producer will harvest or intends to harvest for sale directly to the public.
This bill would require a producer of these crops to submit this information to the county agricultural commissioner’s office in the county in which the producer’s land or facility is located as part of obtaining or renewing a certified producer certificate. By imposing a new duty on county agricultural commissioners, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(5) Existing law creates in the Department of Food and Agriculture the California Citrus Pest and Disease Prevention Committee and provides for its continuation, and that of the California Citrus Pest and Disease Prevention Program, every 4 years subject to a referendum of the citrus producers on or before June 30, 2013, and every 4 years thereafter. Pursuant to this referendum the department has extended the citrus pest and disease prevention program for an additional 4 years.
Existing law requires the committee to reimburse the Secretary of Food and Agriculture for all reasonable expenditures incurred by the secretary in carrying out his or her duties and responsibilities pursuant to the citrus pest and disease prevention program, including the costs of implementing and administering the administrative, enforcement, and regulatory recommendations of the statewide work plan developed by the committee.
This bill would require the committee to reimburse the secretary for all expenditures incurred by the secretary in carrying out his or her duties and responsibilities pursuant to the program.
(6) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Food and Agricultural Code (the Code) to authorize the Department of Agriculture, with prior approval of the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the State Department of Public Health, to reproduce or distribute biological control organisms that are not detrimental to the public health and safety due to pests or diseases. Declares that the Department shall not engage in the production of beneficial organisms when those organisms are available in sufficient amounts for purchase from commercial sources. (Sec. 2) Allows the Department, by rule or regulation, to provide for the issuance and renewal on a two-year basis of licenses, certificates of registration, or other indicia of authority issued by it by any division, office, or other entity within the Department. Declares that the Department may, by rule or regulation, set the fee for a two-year license, certificate of registration, or other indicia not to exceed twice the annual fee for issuance or renewal set by statute.

"(1) Existing law, on and after January 1, 2016, requires any person operating a modified limousine that is modified prior to July 1, 2015, to ensure that the vehicle is equipped with at least 2 rear side doors and one or 2 rear windows that the rear seat passengers or all passengers of the vehicle may open from the inside of the vehicle in case of any fire or other emergency, as specified.
Under this bill, the requirement that those modified limousines be equipped with one or 2 rear windows would instead apply on and after January 1, 2017. The bill would make other nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.
(2) Existing law requires, not later than July 1, 2016, the Department of the California Highway Patrol to implement a program to conduct safety inspections of modified limousine terminals that are operated by passenger stage corporations pursuant to the Public Utilities Act or by charter-party carriers of passengers pursuant to the Passenger Charter-party Carriers’ Act.

"(1) The Franchise Tax Board administers the Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law and the State Board of Equalization administers the Sales and Use Tax Law and various other tax and fee laws. Counties, cities, and districts, as specified, are authorized to impose local sales or transactions and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to the Sales and Use Tax Law are automatically incorporated into the local laws. Those laws generally require a claim for refund to be filed within specified timeframes based on the date of overpayment or specified board action if any amount has been overpaid, as specified. Under those laws, the rule of res judicata, which provides that a matter that has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction may not be pursued further by the same parties is applicable only if the liability involved is for the same reporting period as was involved in the case previously determined.
This bill would, notwithstanding existing law regarding the rule of res judicata, where a tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount levied or collected by the tax agency, which this bill would define to include the board and the Franchise Tax Board, has been determined to have been illegally levied or collected in a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, authorize any person who paid that tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount to file with the tax agency a claim for refund, within one year after the date of the final and nonappealable decision and would require the tax agency to refund the amount so paid. This bill would also require the tax agency to refund these amounts without the person filing a claim for refund when information in the tax agencies’ records is sufficient to identify the person. This bill would, upon appropriation by the Legislature, allocate the amounts necessary to make these refunds to the applicable tax agency.
(2) Existing law requires an action to recover property taxes levied on state-assessed property arising out of a dispute as to an assessment to be commenced only after payment of the taxes in issue and within 4 years after the latest of the dates that the State Board of Equalization mailed its decision or its written findings and conclusions, as provided.
This bill would instead require, where the tax assessed or allocated has been determined to have been illegally assessed or allocated in a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, the action to commence no later than one year from the date the court rendered that decision.
(3) This bill would make a legislative finding and declaration regarding the public purpose served by the bill.","Provides that a person who paid a tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount to a tax agency has been determined to have been illegally levied or collected in a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, any person who paid that tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount may file with the tax agency a claim for refund of the amount so paid and the tax agency shall refund the amount so paid. Specifies that a person who has paid to the tax agency a tax, fee, assessment, surcharge, or other amount described in this Act that filed a claim for refund prior to the effective date of this Act that the tax agency has not refunded before that date shall be refunded by the tax agency to the person in accordance with this Act. Specifies that this Act shall: (1) apply to any claims for refund of any amounts described in this Act; (2) be filed within one year after the date upon which the court decision described in this Act becomes final and nonappealable; and (3) require interest to be paid on the refunds provided by this Act in accordance with applicable provisions of the Revenue and Taxation Code."
"Existing law authorizes public agencies to contract with the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System to have their employees become members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS). Existing law, with respect to the Counties of Kern, Los Angeles, and Orange, permits the board to enter into an agreement with the contracting agency’s board of retirement for termination of the contracting agency’s participation in PERS and inclusion of the agency’s employees in the retirement system of the city or county, if specified requirements are met, with respect to certain safety members, including firefighters. The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 establishes a corresponding authority for accepting these people as members for retirement systems created pursuant to its provisions, and granting them service credit for their service credited by PERS.
This bill would expand the application of the provisions described above to the County of San Bernardino.","Amends the Government Code to authorize the board of retirement of a county maintaining a county retirement system to enter into an agreement with the board of retirement of a public agency whose contract has been in effect for at least five years in this system or the state with respect to certain safety members who have ceased to be employed by the public agency or the state and have been employed by a county, fire authority, or district as a result of a transfer of firefighting or law enforcement functions from the public agency or the state to the county, fire authority, or district and inclusion of the former public agency employees in that county retirement system. Applies this Act to the Counties of Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino."
"Existing law authorizes a public transportation agency to adopt and enforce an ordinance to impose and enforce civil administrative penalties for fare evasion or other passenger misconduct, other than by minors, on or in a transit facility or vehicle in lieu of the criminal penalties otherwise applicable, with specified administrative procedures for the imposition and enforcement of the administrative penalties, including an initial review and opportunity for a subsequent administrative hearing.
This bill would provide that a person who fails to pay the administrative penalty when due or successfully complete the administrative process to dismiss the notice of fare evasion or passenger
misconduct
conduct violation
may be subject to those criminal penalties. The bill would require the notice of fare evasion or passenger
misconduct
conduct violation
to contain a printed statement that the person may be charged with an infraction or misdemeanor if the administrative penalty is not paid when due or dismissed pursuant to these provisions.
The bill would also require the processing agency to dismiss the original notice of fare evasion
or passenger conduct violation
and make no further attempts to collect the administrative penalty if the person is charged with an infraction or misdemeanor after failing to pay the administrative penalty or successfully complete the civil administrative process. The bill would require the processing agency to personally serve the person charged with an infraction or misdemeanor with a new notice of fare evasion
or passenger conduct violation
that sets forth the criminal violation.
Because the bill would expand the scope of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Public Utilities Code to authorize a public transportation agency to enact and enforce an ordinance to impose and enforce an administrative penalty for: (1) evasion of the payment of a fare; (2) misuse of a transfer, pass, ticket, or token with the intent to evade payment; (3) playing sound equipment on or in a system facility or vehicle; (4) smoking, eating, or drinking in or on a system facility or vehicle; (5) expectorating upon a system facility or vehicle; (6) carrying an explosive or acid, flammable liquid, or toxic material in a system facility or vehicle; (7) urinalysis in a system facility or vehicle; and (8) willfully blocking the free movement of another person in a system facility or vehicle.

"Existing law authorizes various state entities to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations for various specified purposes. The Administrative Procedure Act requires the Office of Administrative Law and a state agency proposing to adopt, amend, or repeal a regulation to review the proposed changes for, among other things, consistency with existing state regulations.
This bill, until January 1, 2020, would require each state agency to, on or before January 1, 2019, review that agency’s regulations, identify any regulations that are duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out of date, revise those identified regulations, as provided, and report to the Legislature and Governor, as specified.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.
Existing federal law, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, allocated, until September 30, 2011, $1.5 billion to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Homelessness Prevention Fund, to be used for homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing. Existing federal law, known as the Emergency Solutions Grants Program, provides grants to states, local governments, and private nonprofit organizations, as specified, for specified housing assistance activities. Existing law, the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids Act, provides housing supports to individuals if the administering county determines that the individual or his or her family is experiencing homelessness or housing instability that would be a barrier to self-sufficiency or child well-being and declares that it is the intent of the Legislature that housing supports utilize evidence-based models, including those established in the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program.
This bill would require the Department of Housing and Community Development to establish, upon appropriation of funds in the annual Budget Act, an enhancement program for awarding grants to counties and private nonprofit organizations that operate a rapid rehousing program. The bill would require the department to develop guidelines to select 4 counties and private nonprofit organizations to receive these grant funds and require that eligible counties and private nonprofit organizations include those that are eligible to receive funds from the state pursuant to the Emergency Solutions Grants Program with a demonstrated high funding need. The bill would require the department to give priority to counties with existing programs that have demonstrated effectiveness in providing rapid rehousing for homeless individuals and veterans. This bill would require the department to distribute this money equally to each of the selected counties and private nonprofit organizations, less an amount of up to 5% deducted for administrative purposes. The bill would repeal these provisions as of July 1, 2018.","This bill requires California agencies to: (1) review all provisions of the California Code of Regulations adopted by those agencies; (2) identify any regulations that are duplicative, overlapping, inconsistent, or out-of-date; (3) adopt, amend, or repeal regulations to reconcile or eliminate any duplication, overlap, inconsistencies, or out-of-date provisions; and (4) hold at least one noticed public hearing on proposed revisions to its regulations. The bill requires agencies to notify their departments, boards, or other units of any existing regulations adopted by those units that may duplicate, overlap, or be inconsistent with a regulation adopted by another agency."
"Existing law, the Automotive Repair Act, the violation of which is a crime, establishes the Bureau of Automotive Repair under the supervision and control of the Director of Consumer Affairs. Existing law regulates the business of automotive repair and makes it unlawful for any person to be an automotive repair dealer unless registered with the bureau. Existing law defines an automotive repair dealer and an automotive technician as persons who, among other things, repair motor vehicles.
Existing law defines the “repair of motor vehicles” to mean all maintenance of, and repairs to, motor vehicles, except repairing tires, changing tires, lubricating vehicles, installing light bulbs, batteries, windshield wiper blades, and other minor services.
Existing law defines “automotive technician” as a dealer, or a person employed by a dealer, who performs maintenance, diagnostics, repair, removal or installation of specified integral automotive components, but excluding minor services, as set forth above.
This bill would require the director to adopt regulations prior to January 1, 2018, defining “minor services” for these purposes.
This bill would, until January 1, 2018, include installation of propulsive batteries in the definition of “repair of motor vehicles.”
This bill, commencing January 1, 2018, would recast the definition of “repair of motor vehicles” to delete the listing of the various types of excluded minor services and to specify that minor services do not include the changing of propulsive batteries, and also would exclude roadside services, as defined. The bill would similarly recast the definition of “automotive technician” to delete these references and to delete provisions describing the specific work to be performed by an automotive technician. The bill, commencing January 1, 2018, would include the services performed by an operator of a tow truck owned or operated by a person or entity enrolled in the Basic Inspection of Terminals program, as specified, in the definition of “roadside services.”
This bill would provide that the regulations adopted by the director, prior to January 1, 2018, defining “minor services” continue in effect on and after January 1, 2018.
Because the failure of a person installing propulsive batteries to register as a repair dealer or technician with the bureau would constitute a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The bill would make the operation of its provisions contingent upon the enactment of SB 778 of the 2015–16 Regular Session.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on September 25, 2017.

"Existing law, the Dills Act, governs collective bargaining between the state and recognized state public employee organizations. Existing law excludes certain employees from coverage under the Dills Act, including, among others, managerial employees, supervisory employees, and confidential employees, as defined. Existing law creates the Public Employment Relations Board and authorizes it, among other things, to determine appropriate state employee bargaining units, as specified. The California Constitution prescribes the membership of the California Supreme Court and requires the Legislature to create appellate court districts, all of which are vested with the judicial power of the state. The California Constitution prescribes the membership and duties of the Judicial Council and authorizes the council to appoint an Administrative Director of the Courts. Existing law creates the Habeas Corpus Resource Center for the purpose of providing representation to people who are convicted and sentenced to death in this state and who are without counsel.
This bill would apply the Dills Act to employees of the Judicial Council, subject to specified exceptions. The bill would define an employee for these purposes as any employee of the Judicial Council, except managerial employees, confidential employees, supervisory employees, and excluded employees, as specified. The bill would grant the Judicial Council the sole authority to designate state employee positions as excluded positions and would prohibit exempted managerial, supervisory, confidential, and excluded positions from exceeding
1/3
of the total authorized Judicial Council positions as stated in the Department of Finance Salaries and Wages Supplement. The bill would prohibit review of the designation of excluded positions by the Public Employment Relations Board. The bill would also except from the definition of employee a judicial officer or employee of the Supreme Court, the courts of appeal, or the Habeas Corpus Resource Center. The bill would define the employer, for purposes of bargaining or meeting and conferring, as the Administrative Director of the Courts, or his or her designated representatives, acting with the authorization of the chairperson of the Judicial Council. The bill would provide that references in the Dills Act to actions or decisions by the Governor, or his or her designated representative, shall mean actions or decisions by the Administrative Director of the Courts. The bill would prohibit the Public Employment Relations Board from including Judicial Council employees in a bargaining unit that includes employees other than those of the Judicial Council.","Authorizes the withdrawal of employees of the State of California from membership in recognized employee organizations, to be used to defray the costs incurred in fulfilling the memorandum of understanding, commencing with the effective date of such memorandum, and general assessments of such organizations."
"Existing law prohibits the suspension, or recommendation for expulsion, of a pupil from school unless the superintendent of the school district or the principal of the school determines that the pupil has committed any of various specified acts, including, but not limited to, engaging in an act of bullying by means of an electronic act. Existing law further defines “electronic act” as both the creation and transmission originated on or off the schoolsite, by means of an electronic device, including, but not limited to, a telephone, wireless telephone, or other wireless communication device, computer, or pager, of a communication, as specified.
This bill would instead, for purposes of pupil suspension or recommendation for expulsion from a school, define “electronic act” as either the creation or transmission of that communication, as specified.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 17, 2014.

"Existing law requires that a vote by mail ballot be available to any registered voter and specifies the manner by which the ballot must be returned. Existing law permits a military or overseas voter who is temporarily living outside of the territorial limits of the United States or the District of Columbia, or is called to military service, to return his or her vote by mail ballot by facsimile transmission to the elections official. The ballot must be received by the closing of the election day polls and accompanied by an identification envelope and an oath of voter declaration in a prescribed form. Existing law requires a military or overseas voter who returns a ballot by facsimile transmission to agree in an oath of voter declaration under penalty of perjury to waive his or her right to a secret ballot and that he or she has not applied for a vote by mail ballot from any other jurisdiction for the election. The elections official is required to determine the voter’s eligibility to vote by comparing the voter’s signature from the materials returned by facsimile transmission to the signature on the voter’s affidavit of registration.
This bill would permit a military or overseas voter to return his or her ballot by electronic mail, as prescribed. The bill would require the ballot to be accompanied by a copy of an identification envelope and an oath of voter declaration in substantially the form described with respect to facsimile transmission of ballots. This bill would require the elections official to determine the voter’s eligibility to vote by comparing the signature on the scanned copy of the identification envelope with the signature on the voter’s affidavit of registration.
This bill would permit a military or overseas voter to cast his or her vote on the Internet by electronically marking his or her ballot and securely transmitting the voted ballot to the appropriate elections official. To be counted, the voted ballot must be received by the voter’s elections official no later than the closing of the polls on election day. These provisions would become operative only if the Secretary of State certifies that he or she has identified and addressed all issues regarding the security of casting a vote using the Internet.
Because the bill requires elections officials to provide a higher level of service and expands the scope of the crime of perjury, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
Existing law requires that a vote by mail ballot be available to any registered voter. Under existing law, a voter may: (1) return the vote by mail ballot by mail or in person to the elections official from whom it came; (2) return the vote by mail ballot in person to a member of a precinct board at a polling place within the jurisdiction, or (3), if unable to return the vote by mail ballot, designate his or her spouse, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, or a person residing in the same household as the vote by mail voter to return the ballot to the elections official from whom it came or to the precinct board at a polling place within the jurisdiction.
This bill would authorize an elections official to send a voter a ballot by secure electronic transmission for an election conducted wholly within the county. This bill would also require a voter who receives a ballot in this manner to print the ballot for return to the elections official.","(Sec. 2) Requires any application made prior to the 60th day before an election to be kept and processed on or after the 60th day before the election. Requires the elections official to send the ballot not earlier than 60 days but not later than 45 days before the election and to include with the ballot a list of all candidates who have qualified for the ballot and a list of all measures that are to be submitted to the voters on which the voter is qualified to vote. Specifies that the military or overseas voter may, in the alternative, use a federal write-in absentee ballot to vote in any election in which such voter is qualified to vote. Requires any name written upon a ballot for a particular office to be counted for the office or nomination, providing the candidate whose name has been written on the ballot has, as of the date of the election, qualified to have his or her name placed on the ballot for the office, or has qualified as a write-in candidate for the office.

The bill would exempt from those prohibitions the sale or promotional offer of a product containing less than 1 part per million (ppm) by weight of plastic microbeads.
The bill would make a violator liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500 per day for each violation. The bill would authorize the penalty to be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by the Attorney General or local officials. The bill would require the civil penalties collected in an action brought pursuant to the act to be retained by the office that brought the action.",This bill prohibits the sale or offer for promotional purposes of any personal care product containing plastic particles measuring five millimeters or less in every dimension. The bill does not alter or diminish any legal obligation to comply with this prohibition.

of their respective governing boards. The bill would require, for each partnership entered into under the bill, the affected community college district and school district to file an annual report, containing specified data, with the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, which would transmit this annual report to the Legislature, the Director of Finance, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the governing boards of the participating school districts and community college districts, as specified.
(2) Existing law requires the governing board of a community college district to assign a low enrollment priority to a pupil attending community college pursuant to a recommendation from his or her principal or school district or a petition from his or her parents, in order to ensure that these pupils, admitted as special part-time or full-time students, do not displace regularly admitted students.
This bill would authorize the governing board of a community college district to assign an enrollment priority to pupils attending community college pursuant to a partnership agreement established under the bill. The bill would require community college districts, in assigning an enrollment priority under this provision, to ensure that these pupils do not displace regularly admitted community college students.
The bill would prohibit a community college district from receiving an allowance or apportionment for an instructional activity for which a school district has been, or will be, paid.
(3) This bill would also make various nonsubstantive changes, and delete obsolete provisions.","Amends the Education Code to allow the governing boards of school districts to determine which pupils would benefit from advanced scholastic or vocational work and to authorize, upon the recommendation of the principal of the pupil's school of attendance and with parental consent, those pupils to attend a community college during any session or term as special part-time or full-time students and to undertake one or more courses of instruction offered at the community college level.

"(1)The After School Education and Safety Program Act of 2002, enacted by initiative statute, establishes the After School Education and Safety Program to serve pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 9, inclusive, at participating public elementary, middle, junior high, and charter schools. The act gives priority enrollment in both after school and before school programs to pupils in middle school or junior high school who attend daily.
This bill would instead give first priority enrollment to homeless youth, as defined, 2nd priority enrollment to pupils in CalWORKs assistance units, as described, and 3rd priority enrollment, for programs serving middle and junior high school pupils, to pupils who attend the program daily.
The act provides that an after school and before school program is not required to charge family fees or conduct individual eligibility determination based on need or income.
This bill would prohibit a program that charges family fees from charging a fee to a family with a homeless youth or a family who is part of a CalWORKs assistance unit.
(2)Existing
Existing
law authorizes the governing board of a school district to provide for the transportation of pupils to and from school whenever in the judgment of the board the transportation is advisable and good reasons exist to do so.
This bill would require a pupil entitled to free or reduced-price meals, or who attends a school that participates in the Community Eligibility Option, to be entitled to free transportation to and from school provided by the local educational agency, if certain conditions are met. The bill would require the local educational agency to designate a liaison to implement a plan, in consultation with specified stakeholders, to ensure that all entitled pupils receive free transportation in a timely manner.
By requiring new duties on a local educational agency, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3)Existing law requires each county to provide cash assistance and other social services to needy families through the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program using federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant program, state, and county funds. Existing law specifies the amounts of cash aid to be paid each month to CalWORKs recipients.
This bill would require that a $200 supplement to the amount of cash aid provided under the program be paid to a CalWORKs recipient 19 years of age and under, upon verification that the recipient has obtained a high school diploma or its equivalent.
The bill would also, among other things, require the State Department of Social Services, in coordination with the State Department of Education, to identify a method and to use that method to track the high school completion rates of children in an assistance unit, and to make publicly available an aggregate report of these high school completion rates tracked by the department.
The bill would require the State Department of Social Services to, in consultation with specified entities, design a youth subsidized employment program for youth 15 to 19 years of age, inclusive, who are eligible for benefits under this bill and needy youth, as defined, and would require the program to provide paid employment, occupational skills training, and other relevant services.

The
California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(Sec. 1) This bill declares that the Legislature finds and declares that it is the intent of the State of California to enact legislation that would support school participation and high school attainment among low-income youth. (Sec. 2) Under current law, every pupil attending a school operating an after-school program is eligible to participate in such program.

The act provides that a violation of its provisions is a misdemeanor if not otherwise specified.
This bill would require a manufacturer, before the first sale of a brand of beer in this state, to register the brand with the department, as specified, and would make the manufacturer responsible for compliance with labeling and registration requirements. The bill, if beer is sold or offered for sale in this state without first complying with these provisions or other provisions of the act, would authorize the department to take action it deems reasonable and necessary including, but not limited to, ordering that the beer not be sold, or allowing it to be sold for a reasonable time, until these requirements are met.

Existing law authorizes the moneys deposited in the Ratepayer Relief Fund to be appropriated for certain purposes for the benefit of ratepayers.
This bill would require the Attorney General or the Public Utilities Commission to enter into an energy settlement agreement solely on a monetary basis and would prohibit the agreement from including nonmonetary compensation in lieu of monetary compensation. The bill would prohibit the commission from distributing or expending the proceeds of claims in any litigation or settlement to obtain ratepayer recovery for the effects of the 2000–02 energy crisis and would require that the proceeds, after reimbursing the commission’s litigation and investigation expenses, be deposited into the Ratepayer Relief Fund. The bill would require the moneys in the fund to be appropriated for those purposes for the benefit of ratepayers.
The California Constitution provides that the Legislature has plenary power to establish the manner and scope of review of commission action in a court of record. Existing law provides that only the Supreme Court and the court of appeal have jurisdiction to review, reverse, correct, or annul any order or decision of the commission or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof, or to enjoin, restrain, or interfere with the commission in the performance of its official duties.
This bill would authorize an action to enforce the requirements of the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act or the California Public Records Act to be brought against the commission in the superior court.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2014.

"Existing federal law, the Immigration and Nationality Act, establishes a procedure for classification of certain aliens as special immigrants who have been declared dependent on a juvenile court, and authorizes those aliens to apply for an adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident within the United States. Under federal regulations, an alien is eligible for special immigrant juvenile status if he or she is under 21 years of age. Existing state law provides that the juvenile, probate, and family divisions of the superior court have jurisdiction to make judicial determinations regarding the custody and care of juveniles within the meaning of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act. Existing law also requires the court, upon request, to make the necessary findings regarding special immigrant juvenile status if there is evidence to support those findings, as specified.
Existing law also establishes the jurisdiction of the probate court. Existing law regulates the establishment and termination of guardianships in probate court, and specifies that a guardian has the care, custody, and control of a ward.

This bill would also authorize a court to extend a guardianship of the person of a ward beyond 18 years of age, as specified, if the ward so requests or consents. The bill would also provide that a guardianship of the person terminates after the ward attains majority unless the ward consents to, or requests the extension of, the guardianship of the person until he or she is 21 years of age, as specified.","This bill amends the probate code in California to allow a relative, or any other person on behalf of the relative, to file a petition for the guardianship of a person between 18 and 21 years of age in connection with a request for the findings necessary to enable the person to petition the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services for classification as a special immigrant juvenile. The court may extend an existing guardianship for purposes of allowing the ward to complete the application process with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services for classification as a special immigrant juvenile."
"The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, generally regulates the disposal, management, and recycling of solid waste. Existing law requires disposal facility operators to submit information to counties from periodic tracking surveys on the disposal tonnages that are disposed of at the disposal facility by jurisdiction or region of origin. Existing law requires solid waste handlers and transfer station operators to provide information to the disposal facility on the origin of the solid waste they deliver to the disposal facility. Existing law requires recycling and composting facilities to submit periodic information to counties on the types and quantities of materials that are disposed of, sold to end users, or sold to exporters or transporters for sale outside of the state, by county of origin. Existing law requires counties to submit periodic reports to the cities within the county, to any regional agency of which the county is a member, and to the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery on the amounts of solid waste disposed of by jurisdiction or region of origin, and on the categories and amounts of solid waste diverted to recycling and composting facilities within the county or region. Existing law authorizes the department to adopt regulations in this regard.
This bill would revise these provisions by, among other things, (1) requiring recycling and composting operations and facilities to submit specified information directly to the department, rather than to counties, (2) requiring disposal facility operators to submit tonnage information to the department, and to counties only on request, and (3) deleting the requirement for counties to submit that information to cities, regional agencies, and the department. The bill would delete references to periodic tracking surveys. The bill would require exporters, brokers, and transporters of recyclables or compost to submit periodic information to the department on the types, quantities, and destinations of materials that are disposed of, sold, or transferred inside or outside of the state, and would authorize the department to provide this information, on an aggregated basis, to jurisdictions, as specified. The bill would make the aggregated information, other than that aggregated by company, public information. The bill would make other related changes to the various reporting requirements. The bill would provide for imposition of civil penalties on any person who refuses or fails to submit information required by the governing regulations, and on any person who knowingly or willfully files a false report, refuses to permit the department to inspect or examine associated records, or alters, cancels, or obliterates entries in the records, as specified. The bill would provide that the civil penalties may be imposed either in a civil action or administratively pursuant to procedures specified in the bill. The bill would specify the types of waste disposal records that are subject to inspection and copying by the department, and also by an employee of a government entity, as defined, with respect to tonnage received at a disposal facility on or after July 1, 2015, that originates within the government entity’s geographic jurisdiction. The bill, with respect to those records, would prohibit a government entity from disclosing the name of a waste hauler using a specific landfill unless necessary as part of an administrative or judicial proceeding, as specified. The bill would also authorize a government entity to petition the superior court for injunctive or declaratory relief to enforce these provisions. The bill would require recovered civil penalties to be deposited in the Integrated Waste Management Account.
The California Public Records Act provides that public records are open to inspection at all times during the office hours of the state or local agency that retains those records, and that every person has a right to inspect any public record, but exempts certain records from those requirements. Existing law, upon the request of any person furnishing any report, notice, application, plan, or other document required by the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, provides that neither the department nor an enforcement agency shall make available for inspection by the public any portion of the report, notice, application, plan, or other document that contains a trade secret, as specified.
This bill would exempt certain waste disposal records subject to inspection and copying by the department or a government entity from disclosure under certain California Public Records Act provisions. The bill would also make certain waste disposal records subject to nondisclosure under the trade secrets provisions.","Directs the department to adopt regulations requiring practices and procedures that are reasonable and necessary to implement this Act and that provide a representative accounting of solid wastes and recyclable materials that are handled, processed, or transferred. Prohibits such regulations from imposing an unreasonable burden on waste and recycling handling, processing, or disposal operations or otherwise interfere with the safe handling, processing, and disposal of solid waste and recyclables. Prescribes civil penalties for: (1) refusing or failing to submit information required by regulations; (2) filing a false report; or (3) failing to keep records."
"The Gambling Control Act provides for the licensure of certain individuals and establishments involved in various gambling activities, and for the regulation of those activities, by the California Gambling Control Commission. Existing law prohibits a person under 21 years of age from being eligible for a work permit in a gambling establishment. Existing law also prohibits a person under 21 years of age from entering the premises of a licensed gambling establishment, except as provided.
This bill would permit a person between 18 and 21 years of age to work in a gambling establishment in a classification that entails providing services on and off the gaming floor that are not involved in play of any controlled game, as specified.
Existing law generally regulates false advertising and specifically prohibits certain unfair acts or practices undertaken by, or omissions of, a person in the operation of a contest, including misrepresenting the odds of winning a prize or failing to award and distribute all prizes.
Existing law specifies that these provisions do not render unlawful or restrict otherwise lawful games and methods used by a gambling enterprise licensed under the Gambling Control Act or operations of the California State Lottery.

"Existing unemployment compensation disability law provides a formula for determining benefits available to qualifying disabled individuals. For an individual who has quarterly base wages of greater than $1,749.20, the weekly benefit is calculated by multiplying base wages by 55% and dividing the result by 13. For a benefit that is not a multiple of $1, existing law provides that the benefit shall be computed to the next higher multiple of $1. However, existing law provides that this amount may not exceed the maximum workers’ compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount.
Under existing law, the family temporary disability insurance program provides up to 6 weeks of wage replacement benefits to workers who take time off work to care for specified persons, or to bond with a minor child within one year of the birth or placement of the child in connection with foster care or adoption. Existing law defines “weekly benefit amount” for purposes of this program to mean the amount of benefits available to qualifying disabled individuals pursuant to unemployment compensation disability law.
This bill would revise the formula for determining benefits available pursuant to unemployment compensation disability law and for the family temporary disability insurance program, for periods of disability commencing after January 1, 2018, but before January 1, 2022, to provide a weekly benefit amount minimum of $50 and increase the wage replacement rate to specified percentages, but not to exceed the maximum workers’ compensation temporary disability indemnity weekly benefit amount established by the Department of Industrial Relations pursuant to existing law.
Existing law deems an individual to be eligible for family temporary disability benefits if, among other things, the individual is unable to perform his or her regular or customary work for a 7-day waiting period during each disability benefit period. and prohibits payments for benefits during this waiting period.
This bill, on and after January 1, 2018, also would remove the 7-day waiting period for these benefits.
This bill, by authorizing an increase in the expenditure of money from the Unemployment Compensation Disability Fund, would make an appropriation.
This bill would require, by July 1, 2017, the Employment Development Department to report to the Assembly Committee on Insurance and Senate Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations specified information regarding the waiting period for disability benefits. The bill also would require, by March 1, 2021, the department to prepare a report to the Legislature and specified legislative committees on levels and trends regarding utilization, costs, and rates with respect to family leave and disability insurance.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 2, 2017. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Unemployment Insurance Code to revise the formula for calculating the weekly benefit amount for individuals receiving unemployment compensation.

If a benefit is payable under this formula for periods of disability commencing on or after January 1, 1990, and before January 1, 2000, the benefit amount shall be 55 percent of the highest quarterly wages paid to an individual for employment by employers during the quarter or his or her disability base period, divided by 13, but not exceeding two hundred dollars ($266) or the maximum workers weekly benefit amount, whichever is less. If the benefit is not a multiple of one dollar $1, it shall be computed to the next higher multiple of one dollar $1. If the benefit is not payable under this formula for periods of disability commencing on or after January 1, 1991, but before January 1, 2000, the benefit amount shall be 55 percent of the highest quarterly wages paid to an individual for employment by employers during the quarter or his or her disability base period in which these wages were the highest.

The act provides that engaging in repeated acts of unprofessional conduct is a crime.
This bill would expand the definition of unprofessional conduct to include any act of abuse towards a patient and any act of administering unsafe respiratory care procedures, protocols, therapeutic regimens, or diagnostic testing or monitoring techniques.

The bill also would authorize a court to order participation in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of release on bond for a person who has been charged with a crime described above. The bill would permit a person whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked for certain violations, and who subsequently applies to the department for a restricted driving privilege, to be permitted to participate in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of obtaining the restricted driving privilege as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, participation in an ignition interlock device program. The bill would define a “24/7 Sobriety program,” in part, as requiring a person in the program to abstain from alcohol and unauthorized controlled substances and be subject to frequent testing for alcohol and controlled substances, as specified. The bill would require a person participating in the program to pay the program costs, commensurate with the person’s ability to pay, as specified.
Existing law provides that all records of the Department of Motor Vehicles relating to the registration of vehicles, other information contained on an application for a driver’s license, abstracts of convictions, and certain abstracts of accident reports are required to be open to public inspection during office hours, except when a specific provision of law prohibits the disclosure of records or information or provides for confidentiality.

The bill would provide that the insurance agent or broker of the insurer, insurance licensee, employer, or prospective employer is authorized to transmit motor vehicle records for these purposes, as specified, and would specify that an insurance agent or broker who has lawfully transmitted a record as authorized under these provisions is not responsible for the subsequent handling of that record by any recipient who is authorized to receive the record under these provisions. The bill would also delete an obsolete cross-reference.",". The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.) (Sec. 2) This bill authorizes a court in California to order a person convicted of certain alcohol-impaired driving violations to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a qualified 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of probation, parole, sentence, or work permit if the program is available and deemed appropriate and the person committed the current violation within 10 years of one or more separate violations that resulted in a conviction. The court may require a person who has been arrested for such a violation to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a qualified 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of release on bond if the program is available and deemed appropriate and the person committed the current violation within 10 years of one or more separate violations that resulted in a conviction. A person whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked and who subsequently applies to the department for a restricted driving privilege shall be permitted to enroll and participate in, and successfully complete, a qualified 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of obtaining the restricted driving privilege if the program is available and deemed appropriate and the person committed the current violation within 10 years of one or more separate violations that resulted in a conviction.

"Existing law requires the Department of Water Resources to identify the extent of monitoring of groundwater elevations that is being undertaken within each groundwater basin or subbasin and to prioritize basins or subbasins as high, medium, low, or very low priority, and requires the initial priority for each basin to be established no later than January 31, 2015. Existing law, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, requires all groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins by the department that are designated as basins subject to critical conditions of overdraft to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2020, and requires all other groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2022, except as specified. The act requires a local agency, any time the department changes these basin priorities and elevates a basin to a medium- or high-priority basin after January 31, 2015, to either establish a groundwater sustainability agency within 2 years of reprioritization and adopt a groundwater sustainability plan within 5 years of reprioritization, or to submit an alternative to the department that the local agency believes satisfies the objectives of these provisions within 2 years of reprioritization.
This bill would impose the requirement to establish a groundwater sustainability agency or submit an alternative after reprioritization on a local agency or combination of local agencies overlying a groundwater basin.
The act authorizes a groundwater sustainability agency to impose fees to fund the costs of a groundwater sustainability program and requires a groundwater sustainability agency to hold at least one public meeting prior to imposing or increasing a fee. The act requires, at least 10 days prior to the meeting, a groundwater sustainability agency to make available to the public data upon which the proposed fee is based.
This bill would require a groundwater sustainability agency to make the data upon which the proposed fee is based available 20 days prior to the public meeting to impose or increase a fee.
This bill would incorporate changes to Section 10722.4 of the Water Code proposed by both this bill and SB 13, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on June 23, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Water Code to replace requirements for the establishment of a state groundwater sustainability agency with requirements for the prioritization of groundwater basins. Directs the Department of the Interior, for purposes of establishing a groundwater sustainability agency, to categorize each basin as one of the following priorities: high priority; medium priority; low priority; very low priority; and any time Interior updates Bulletin 118 boundaries, it shall reassess the prioritization. Provides that any time Interior changes the basin priorities, if a basin is elevated to a medium- or high-priority basin after January 31, 2015, a local agency, or combination of local agencies overlying a groundwater basin, shall have two years from the date of reprioritization to either establish a groundwater sustainability agency or adopt a groundwater sustainability plan pursuant to this Act. Provides that if Interior changes priorities to elevate a basin from a low- or very low priority basin to a medium- or high-priority basin after January 31, 2015, the agency formation and planning deadlines of this Act shall be extended as follows: a local agency, or combination of local agencies overlying a groundwater basin, shall have two years from the date of reprior"
"Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations, as defined. Decisions of the commission adopted the California Solar Initiative. Existing law requires the commission to undertake certain steps in implementing the California Solar Initiative.
This bill would make a nonsubstantive change to the law requiring the commission to undertake certain steps in implementing the California Solar Initiative.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on November 6, 2007. The summary of that version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) Amends the Public Utilities Code to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to authorize, in implementing the California Solar Initiative, the award of monetary incentives for up to the first megawatt of alternating current generated by solar energy systems that meet certain eligibility criteria. Provides that, following implementation of the Initiative, the incentive level authorized by FERC shall decline each year following implementation and shall be zero as of December 31, 2016. Requires FERC to: (1) adopt and publish a schedule of declining incentive levels no less than 30 days in advance of the first decline; and (2) adopt a performance-based incentive program for solar energy systems of 100 percent of incentives for solar energy systems of 100 kilowatts or greater, at least 50 percent of incentives for solar energy systems of 30 kilowatts or greater, based on the actual electrical output of the solar energy systems. Directs FERC to: (1) encourage, and may require, performance-based incentives for solar energy systems of less than 30 kilowatts; (2) require reasonable and cost-effective energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings as a condition of providing incentives for eligible solar energy systems, with appropriate exemptions"
"Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to implement the Alternative and Renewable Fuel Vehicle Technology Program to provide financial assistance to develop and deploy innovative technologies that transform California’s fuel and vehicle types to help attain the state’s climate change policies. Existing law includes within the program alternative and renewable fuel infrastructure, fueling stations, and equipment.
This bill would specify that alternative and renewable fuel infrastructure includes electric vehicle charging infrastructure in disadvantaged communities.
Existing law, the Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Open Access Act, prohibits the charging of a subscription fee on persons desiring to use an electric vehicle charging station, as defined, and prohibits a requirement for persons to obtain membership in any club, association, or organization as a condition of using the station, except as specified. The act authorizes the State Air Resources Board to adopt interoperability billing standards for network roaming payment methods for electric vehicle charging stations if no interoperability billing standards have been adopted by a national standards organization by January 1, 2015. The act provides that if the state board adopts interoperability billing standards, all electric vehicle charging stations that require payment shall meet those standards within one year.
This bill would change the date of the state board’s conditional authorization to adopt those interoperability billing standards to January 1, 2016, and would require the electric vehicle charging stations to meet those standards within 6 months.","Creates the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program to provide funding to develop and deploy technology and alternative renewable fuels in the marketplace, without adopting any one preferred fuel or technology.<n><n>Requires the California Energy Commission to provide preferences to those projects that maximize the goals of the Program, based on a proposed criteria, as applicable: (1) the project's ability to provide a measurable transition from the exclusive use of petroleum fuels to a diverse portfolio of viable alternative fuels that meet petroleum reduction and alternative fuel use goals; (2) the project's ability to reduce criteria air pollutants and air toxics and reduce or avoid multimedia environmental impacts; (3) the project's ability to reduce, on a life-cycle basis, the discharge of water pollutants or any other substances known to damage human health or the environment in comparison to the production and use of California reformulated gasoline or diesel fuel produced and sold pursuant to California diesel fuel regulations; (4) the project's ability to decrease, on a life-cycle basis, the discharge of water pollutants or any other substances known to damage human health or the environment in comparison to the production and use of California reformulated gasoline or diesel fuel produced and sold pursuant to California diesel fuel regulations; (5) the project provides nonstate matching funds; and (6) the project"
"(1) Existing law makes it a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 2, 3, or 4 years to unlawfully possess any amount of a substance containing cocaine base, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, or phencyclidine while armed with a loaded, operable firearm.
This bill would instead make that felony punishable in a county jail. By requiring the felony to be served in county jail, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law imposes an enhancement of 3, 4, or 5 years on the sentence of a person who is personally armed with a firearm in the commission of a violation of specified controlled substance offenses.
This bill would require the enhancement to be served in state prison.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Makes every person who unlawfully possesses any amount of a substance containing cocaine base, a substance containing cocaine, a substance containing heroin, a substance containing methamphetamine, a crystalline substance containing phencyclidine, a liquid substance containing phencyclidine, plant material containing phencyclidine, or a hand-rolled cigarette treated with phencyclidine while armed with a loaded, operable firearm guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years.

"Existing law allows an immediate family member or a law enforcement officer to request a court to issue a gun violence restraining order to enjoin a person from owning or possessing a firearm or ammunition for a period of one year upon a showing that the person poses a significant danger of personal injury to himself, herself, or another and that a gun violence restraining order is necessary to prevent that injury. Existing law requires a person who is subject to a gun violence restraining order to surrender his or her firearms and ammunition immediately upon request of any law enforcement officer. If no request is made, existing law requires the person to surrender his or her firearms or ammunition to a local law enforcement agency or to sell his or her firearms or ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer within 24 hours.
Existing law allows any person who is prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm to transfer his or her firearms to a licensed firearms dealer for the duration of the prohibition.
This bill would allow a person who is subject to a gun violence restraining order to transfer his or her firearms or ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer for the duration of the prohibition. If the firearms or ammunition have been surrendered to a law enforcement agency, the bill would entitle the owner to have them transferred to a licensed firearms dealer. The bill would additionally provide for the transfer of ammunition to a licensed firearms dealer by any person who is prohibited from owning or possessing ammunition. By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law allows a city, county, or city and county to impose a charge relating to the seizure, impounding, storage, or release of a firearm, which may not exceed the actual costs incurred for expenses directly related to taking possession of a firearm, storing the firearm, and surrendering possession of the firearm to a licensed firearm dealer or to the owner.
This bill would extend the authority to impose this charge for the above specified activities in regard to ammunition.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Penal Code to provide that a person subject to a gun violence restraining order shall not have in his or her custody or control, own, purchase, possess, or receive any firearms or ammunition while that order is in effect. <n>Requires, upon issuance of such an order, the court to order the restrained person to surrender all firearms and ammunition in the restrained person's custody or control, or which the restrained person possesses or owns, upon request of any law enforcement officer, to the control of the officer, after being served with the restraining order. <n>Provides that, if no request is made by a law enforcement officer, the surrender shall occur within 24 hours of being served with the order, by surrendering all firearms and ammunition in a safe manner to the control of the local law enforcement agency, selling them to a licensed firearms dealer, or transferring them to a licensed dealer in accordance with this Act.

"Existing law creates the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training and requires it to develop and disseminate guidelines and training for all law enforcement officers, as described. Existing law prohibits a peace officer from engaging in racial profiling and requires the training to prescribe patterns, practices, and protocols that prevent racial profiling, as defined. Existing law requires the Legislative Analyst’s Office to conduct a study of the data that is voluntarily collected by jurisdictions that have instituted a program of data collection with regard to racial profiling.
This bill would enact the Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015, which would, among other changes, revise the definition of racial profiling to instead refer to racial or identity profiling, and make a conforming change to the prohibition against peace officers engaging in that practice.
The bill would require, beginning July 1, 2016, the Attorney General to establish the Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board (RIPA) to eliminate racial and identity profiling and improve diversity and racial and identity sensitivity in law enforcement. The bill would specify the composition of the board.

The bill would require an agency that employs 1,000 or more peace officers to issue its first annual report by April 1, 2019. The bill would require an agency that employs 667 or more but less than 1,000 peace officers to issue its first annual report by April 1, 2020. The bill would require an agency that employs 334 or more but less than 667 peace officers to issue its first annual report by April 1, 2022. The bill would require an agency that employs one or more but less than 334 peace officers to issue its first annual report by April 1, 2023.
By imposing a higher level of service on local entities that employ peace officers, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on October 6, 2015.

"Existing law provides that the spouse of a woman who conceives through assisted reproduction with semen donated by a man not her husband is treated as if he or she were the natural parent of the child. Existing law further provides that the donor of semen provided to a licensed physician or to a licensed sperm bank for use in artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization of a woman other than the donor’s wife is treated as if he were not the natural father of the child.
This bill would provide that the donor of semen provided to a licensed physician and surgeon or to a licensed sperm bank for use in assisted reproduction is treated as if he were not the natural parent of the child unless otherwise agreed to in a writing signed by the donor and woman prior to the conception of the child.

(2) Existing law requires an employer to indemnify his or her employees for all that the employee necessarily expends or loses in direct consequence of the discharge of the employee’s duties or as a result of obeying the employer’s directions. Existing law provides an aggrieved employee with a private right of action to recover these expenditures.

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Education Code, with respect to dual enrollment, to prohibit any school district in California from assigning any pupil enrolled in any of grades 9 to 12 without educational content for more than one week in any semester, unless: the pupil or, for a pupil who has not reached the age of majority, the pupil's parent, guardian, or educational rights holder has consented in writing to the assignment; a school official has determined that the pupil will benefit from being assigned to the course period; or the principal or assistant principal of the school has stated in a written document maintained at the school that, for the relevant school year, no pupils are assigned to those classes unless the school has met the conditions set forth in this Act. Under no circumstances shall a school district assign a pupil enrolled in any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in a school in the school district to a course period without educational content because there are not sufficient curricular course offerings for the pupil to take during the relevant period of the designated school day. A course period is defined as one course period during which: the pupil is sent home or released from campus before the conclusion of the designated school"
"(1) Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to prescribe, by regulation, lighting, insulation climate control system, and other building design and construction standards that increase the efficiency in the use of energy and water for new residential and new nonresidential buildings. Existing law also requires the commission to prescribe, by regulation, energy and water conservation design standards for new residential and new nonresidential buildings. In order to implement these requirements, existing law requires the commission to develop a public domain computer program that enables contractors, builders, architects, engineers, and government officials to estimate energy consumed by residential and nonresidential buildings.
This bill would require the commission to approve and make publicly available, not less than 6 months prior to the effective date of adopted or updated efficiency standards, a version of the public domain computer program that will function properly with these adopted or updated standards. The bill would require the commission, before approving the public domain computer program for use with adopted or updated standards, to perform preliminary tests of the public domain computer program using common examples of residential and nonresidential buildings and building systems to ensure the usability of the program. The bill would require the commission to make the results of those preliminary tests publicly available.
(2) Existing law requires the commission to establish criteria for adopting a statewide home energy rating program for residential dwellings.
For existing single-family residential dwellings and multifamily residential dwellings with up to 4 units, this bill would require the commission, in administering the statewide home energy rating program, to ensure that energy assessment tools
used
approved
by the commission are routinely adjusted to improve modeling accuracy and to ensure that consumers receive a notice with the output of the energy assessment tools explaining the assumptions used in the energy assessment tools and how they may differ from actual usage patterns.","Amends the Public Resources Code to direct the State Building Standards Commission to: (1) develop a public domain computer program that will enable contractors, builders, architects, engineers, and government officials to estimate the energy consumed by residential and nonresidential buildings; (2) establish a formal process for certification of compliance options for new products, materials, and calculation methods; (3) publish annually the results of its certification decisions and instructions to users and local building officials concerning compliance with the building standards for new products, materials, or calculation methods; (4) charge a fee for the use of the program, which shall be based upon the actual cost of the program, including any computer costs; and (5) conduct a pilot project field testing the requirements of such program throughout and identify potential needed changes to further monitor the assumptions of actual residential buildings to increase the accuracy of the modeling of the public domain computer program.Requires the Commission to: (1) certify an energy conservation manual for use by designers, builders, and contractors of residential and nonresidential buildings; and (2) do both preliminary tests of the public domain computer program by users and make the results publicly available."
"Existing law, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, enacted by Proposition 47, as approved by the voters at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, among other things, established the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, which is funded by savings that accrue to the state from the implementation of the act. The act provides that, among other purposes, 25% of the funds shall be disbursed to the State Department of Education to administer a grant program to public agencies aimed at improving outcomes for public school pupils by reducing truancy and supporting pupils who are at risk of dropping out of school or are victims of crime.
This bill would establish the Learning Communities for School Success Program for the purpose of implementing that grant program, subject to an appropriation to the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund in the annual Budget Act or another statute for the purposes of the bill. The bill would specify the administrative duties and responsibilities of the department with respect to the program, including administering grants and coordinating assistance to local educational agencies, as defined. The bill would set forth criteria to guide the department in awarding grants under the program, and would specify the purposes for which grant funds may be used. The bill would require the department to submit a final evaluation of the program to the Legislature on or before January 31, 2020.
These provisions would become operative only if SB 527 of the 2015–16 Regular Session is chaptered and becomes operative on or before January 1, 2017.","This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Department of Education, through the Learning Communities for School Success program, to administer grants and coordinate assistance to local educational agencies (LEAs) to support their identification and implementation of evidence-based, nonpunitive programs and practices that are aligned with the goals for pupil success contained in their local control and accountability plans. Each LEA that chooses to apply for funding under this program must include information about the department's plans for overall evaluation of its plans for achieving such goals."
"Existing law provides for certain services, protections, and benefits for veterans. Existing law establishes a 3-percent participation goal for disabled veteran business enterprises in state procurement.
This bill would allow entities meeting specified requirements to apply to the Department of Veterans Affairs to become certified California veteran service providers. The bill would require the department to maintain a list of certified California veteran service providers on its Internet Web site, including the type of supportive services provided by the providers. The bill would require that certification would remain valid for 3 years unless the entity is decertified by the department. The bill would require the department, no later than July 1, 2017, to adopt rules, procedures, and regulations as necessary to
certify an entity, and to
decertify an entity if it no longer meets the requirements to be a certified California veteran service provider.
The bill would require the department to adopt a fee to defray the department’s reasonable cost of certification not to exceed $750.","This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to certify veteran service providers in California as having established histories of providing supportive services and that meet specified requirements, including that at least three two of the services are supportive of veterans and their families. A certification approved by the VA shall be valid for three years from the date the VA decertifies the provider. The VA may accept current certifications and licenses from any other state entity, agency, or department in order to provide such certification. The VA may accept an organization as support for certification of a certified provider pursuant to this bill."
"The Diesel Fuel Tax Law imposes a tax upon the removal, entry, sale, delivery, or specified use of diesel fuel, at a specified rate per gallon. That law provides for a reimbursement of the amount of that tax to persons who have used that tax-paid fuel in specified nontaxable uses, which is allowed through a claim for refund.
This bill would allow a claim for refund for amounts of tax paid on the biodiesel fuel portion of dyed blended biodiesel fuel removed from an approved terminal at the terminal rack, as provided, to the extent a supplier can show that the tax on that biodiesel fuel has been paid by the same supplier.","Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code, with respect to the refund of excise taxes on diesel fuel, to require the refund of any tax paid on diesel fuel lost, sold, or removed, or used in a nontaxable use, other than on a farm for farming purposes or in an exempt bus operation. Permits a claim for refund with respect to diesel fuel only if all of the following apply: tax was imposed on the diesel fuel to which the claim relates; the claimant bought or produced the diesel fuel and did not sell or resell it in California except as provided in this Act; the claimant has filed a timely claim for refund that contains specified information and is supported by the original invoice or original facsimile of the bill of lading or fuel manifest that can be directly tied to the electronic invoice; and the diesel fuel was any of the following: used for purposes other than operating motor vehicles upon public highways of the state; exported for use outside this state unless it becomes subject to tax as an import under the laws of the destination state; used in any construction equipment exempt from vehicle registration pursuant to the Vehicle Code while operated within the confines and limits of a construction project; used in the operation of a motor vehicle on any highway that is under the jurisdiction of the United States Department"
"Existing law, the Administrative Procedure Act, governs, among other things, the procedures for the adoption, amendment, or repeal of regulations by state agencies and for the review of those regulatory actions by the Office of Administrative Law. Existing law requires a state agency proposing to adopt, amend, or repeal specific administrative regulations to assess the potential for adverse economic impact on California business enterprises and individuals and to prepare an economic impact assessment, as specified, that addresses, among other things, the creation or elimination of jobs within the state.
This bill would, with certain exceptions, authorize a state agency, when preparing the economic impact assessment, to use a consolidated definition of small business to determine the number of small businesses within the economy, a specific industry sector, or geographic region, and would define “small business” for that purpose as a business that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in its field of operation, and has fewer than 100 employees.","This bill requires state agencies proposing to adopt, amend, or repeal any administrative regulation to assess the potential for adverse economic impact on California business enterprises and individuals, avoiding the imposition of unnecessary or unreasonable regulations, reporting, recordkeeping, or compliance requirements.

"(1) The existing California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989, which is administered by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, establishes an integrated waste management program. Existing law requires each city, county, city and county, and regional agency, if any, to develop a source reduction and recycling element of an integrated waste management plan. Those entities are required to divert 50% of all solid waste through source reduction, recycling, and composting.
This bill would require the California Environmental Protection Agency, in coordination with the department, the State Water Resources Control Board, the State Air Resources Board, and the Department of Food and Agriculture, to develop and implement policies to aid in diverting organic waste from landfills by promoting the composting of specified organic waste and by promoting the appropriate use of that compost throughout the state. The bill would require the agency to promote a goal of reducing at least 5 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year through the development and application of compost on working lands, and would require the agency to work with the Department of Food and Agriculture to achieve this goal. The bill would also require the Secretary for Environmental Protection and the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to ensure proper coordination of agency regulations and goals to implement these requirements and would require the agency and the Department of Food and Agriculture, with the department, the State Water Resources Control Board, and the State Air Resources Board, to perform other specified functions. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2021.
(2) Existing law requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to adopt regulations relating to waste management, including standards for the design, operation, maintenance, and ultimate reuse of solid waste facilities, and for solid waste handling, transfer, composting, transformation, and disposal. Existing law prohibits the solid waste handling, transfer, composting, transformation, and disposal standards from including any requirement that is under the authority of the State Air Resources Board for the prevention of air pollution or the State Water Resources Control Board for the prevention of water pollution and prohibits the solid waste facilities standards from including aspects of solid waste handling and disposal that are within the jurisdiction of the State Air Resources Board, air pollution control districts, and air quality management districts, or the State Water Resources Control Board or a regional water district.
Existing law prohibits a person from discharging a quantity of air contaminants or other material that causes injury, detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to the public, or that endangers the comfort, repose, health, or safety of the public, or that causes injury or damage to business or property, except as provided.
Under existing law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the State Water Resources Control Board and the California regional water quality control boards are the principal state agencies with responsibility for the coordination and control of water quality in the state. The act, with certain exceptions, requires a waste discharger to file certain information with the appropriate regional board and to pay an annual fee.
This bill would require, until January 1, 2021, the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, in coordination with the State Air Resources Board and the State Water Resources Control Board, to develop a policy that promotes the development of coordinated permitting and regulation of composting facilities while protecting the environment.","This bill requires the California Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and implement policies to aid in diverting organic waste from landfills by promoting the use of agricultural, forestry, and urban organic waste as a feedstock for compost and promoting the appropriate use of that compost throughout the state. In developing such policies, the EPA must promote a goal of reducing at least five million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year through the development and application of compost on working lands, which include, but are not limited to, agricultural land, land used for forestry, and rangeland. The EPA and the Department of Food and Agriculture must ensure proper coordination of agency regulations and goals to implement this bill. The bill requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to: (1) develop a policy that promotes the development of coordinated permitting and regulation of composting facilities while protecting the environment, (2) meet at least quarterly with stakeholders to encourage the continued viability of the states organic waste processing and recycling infrastructure, and (3) post this bill on its website."
"Under existing law, a man is conclusively presumed to be the father of a child if he was married to and cohabiting with the child’s mother, except as specified. Existing law also provides that if a man signs a voluntary declaration of paternity, it has the force and effect of a judgment of paternity, subject to certain exceptions. Existing law provides that these presumptions are rebuttable.
This bill would state that a person’s offer or refusal to sign a voluntary declaration of paternity may be considered as a factor, but shall not be determinative as to the issue of legal parentage in any proceedings regarding the establishment or termination of parental rights.
Existing law requires a nonattorney surrogacy facilitator to direct his or her client to deposit client funds in an independent, bonded escrow account or a trust account maintained by an attorney, subject to specified withdrawal requirements.
This bill would additionally require a nonattorney donor facilitator to direct his or her client to deposit client funds, as specified above.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 15, 2010.

"Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health under the direction of the State Public Health Officer. Existing law sets forth the powers and duties of the State Public Health Officer, including, but not limited to, designation as the State Registrar of Vital Statistics, having supervisory powers over local registrars and responsibility for the uniform and thorough enforcement of provisions relating to the registration of certain vital statistics.
Existing law requires that each death be registered with the local registrar of births and deaths in the district in which the death was officially pronounced or the body was found. Existing law sets forth the persons responsible for completing the certificate of death and the required contents of the certificate, including, but not limited to, the decedent’s name, sex, and birthplace. Certain violations of these requirements are a crime.
This bill, commencing July 1, 2016, would require a person completing the certificate of death to record whether the decedent was ever in the Armed Forces of the United States and to include in the items relating to health data information, information on whether the cause of death is any manner of suicide. The bill would also require the local registrar to make information on veteran suicide available to the Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Veterans Affairs.
By changing the definition of existing crimes, and by increasing the responsibility of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.

This bill, until January 1, 2022, would establish the Cancer Clinical Trials Foundation in the Health and Human Services Agency, to be governed by a board of trustees. Members of the board would be appointed as specified. The bill would also create the Cancer Clinical Trials Fund, to be used to administer a grant program. The bill would limit the amount the agency may spend to establish the foundation to $300,000 of appropriated funds, to be repaid by January 1, 2021, but would otherwise prohibit General Fund moneys from being used for the foundation. The bill would authorize the board to solicit and receive money, as specified, and would authorize the agency to apply for federal funds for this purpose. The bill would require the board, upon contribution of at least $500,000 to the fund, to establish the Cancer Clinical Trials Grant Program, in order to increase patient access to cancer clinical trials in specified populations. The bill would require that grant money be used for designated purposes, and would also require grant recipients to report to the board.

"Existing law sets wage, hour, meal break requirements, and other working conditions for employees and requires an employer to pay overtime wages as specified to an employee who works in excess of a workday or workweek, as defined, and imposes criminal penalties for the violation of these requirements. Existing law exempts agricultural employees from these requirements. Under existing law, the function of the Department of Industrial Relations is to, among other things, foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners of California, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment.
This bill would remove the exemption for agricultural employees regarding hours, meal breaks, and other working conditions, including specified wage requirements, and would create a schedule that would phase in overtime requirements for agricultural workers, as defined, over the course of 4 years, from 2019 to 2022, inclusive. Beginning January 1, 2022, the bill would require any work performed by a person, employed in an agricultural occupation, in excess of 12 hours in one day to be compensated at the rate of no less than twice the employee’s regular rate of pay. The bill would provide employers who employ 25 or fewer employees an additional 3 years to comply with the phasing in of these overtime requirements. The bill would authorize the Governor to delay the implementation of these overtime pay provisions if the Governor also suspends the implementation of a scheduled state minimum wage increase, as specified. The bill would require the Department of Industrial Relations to update a specified wage order for consistency with these provisions, as specified.
The bill would create a state-mandated local program by including agricultural employees as a class of employees protected by criminal penalties under existing law.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Labor Code to exempt employees in an agricultural occupation in California from federal overtime requirements if: (1) the nature of the employment reasonably requires that the employee work seven or more consecutive days, if in each calendar month the employee receives days of rest equivalent to one days rest in seven; and (2) the requirement respecting the equivalent of one day or more rest in seven shall apply, notwithstanding other provisions of the Code relating to collective bargaining agreements where the employer and labor organization representing employees have entered into a valid collective bargaining agreement respecting the hours of work of the employees, unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise. The Department of Labor may, when in his or her judgment hardship will result from such exemption, exempt any employer or employees from federal overtime requirements if such exemption will result from a valid collective bargaining agreement where the employer and labor organization representing employees have entered into a valid collective bargaining agreement respecting the hours of work of the employees, unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise. The bill declares that it is the intent of the Legislature to enact the Phase-In Overtime for Agricultural Workers Act of 2016 to provide any person employed in an agricultural occupation in California with an opportunity to earn overtime compensation under the same standards as millions of other employees."
"The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment.
CEQA establishes procedures by which a person may seek judicial review of the decision of the lead agency made pursuant to CEQA and the judicial remedies available.
This bill would authorize each Member of the Legislature to nominate one project within his or her respective district each year, and the Governor to designate those projects as priority projects if the projects meet specified requirements. The bill would require the Governor to provide a notice of the designation to the appropriate lead agency and to the Office of Planning and Research. The bill would require the lead agency to notify the public and interested stakeholders of the designation, as specified, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program. The bill would require that an environmental impact report be prepared for each priority project, but would authorize tiering from previously prepared reports, as specified. The bill would prohibit the court from staying or enjoining the implementation of a priority project unless the court makes specified findings and would limit any stay or injunction, as provided.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

Priority Project Parity Act of 2015 (Sec. 2) This bill declares that the purpose of the California Environmental Quality Act is to enhance public disclosure of the environmental impacts of a project and to require feasible mitigation measures or alternative project configurations that reduce significant adverse impacts to the physical environment, and is limited to those that allow the project to achieve its objectives, fall within the jurisdiction of the lead agency, and be readily implemented from a legal, technical, and economic perspective. If, notwithstanding the feasible mitigation measures or alternative configuration, a project would have a significant unavoidable adverse impact on the physical environment or substantially contribute to an unavoidable significant adverse cumulative impact on the physical environment, an agency may nevertheless approve the project by adopting a statement explaining the employment, environmental, social, economic, or other benefits that have informed the agency's decision to approve the project. The purpose of CE is to enhance public disclosure of the environmental impacts of a project and to require feasible mitigation measures or alternative project configurations that reduce significant adverse impacts to the physical environment."
"Existing law authorizes a county to establish a repository and distribution program under which a pharmacy, including a pharmacy that is owned by, or contracts with, the county, may distribute surplus unused medications, as defined, to persons in need of financial assistance to ensure access to necessary pharmaceutical therapies. Under existing law, only medication that is donated in unopened, tamper-evident packaging or modified unit dose containers that meet the United States Pharmacopoeia standards, and that includes lot numbers and expiration dates, is eligible for donation to the program. Existing law prohibits medication that does not meet the requirements for donation and distribution from being sold, dispensed, or otherwise transferred to any other entity. Existing law requires medication donated to the repository and distribution program to be maintained in the donated packaging units.
This bill would authorize a pharmacy that exists solely to operate the repository and distribution program to repackage a reasonable quantity of donated medicine in anticipation of dispensing the medicine to its patient population. The bill would require a pharmacy that repackages medication to have repackaging policies and procedures in place for identifying and recalling medications, and to label the repackaged medicine with the earliest expiration date.","Directs the county board of supervisors, the public health officer, and the California State Board of Pharmacy to establish written procedures for: (1) establishing eligibility for medically indigent patients who may participate in the program; (2) ensuring that patients eligible for the program shall not be charged for any medications provided; (3) developing a formulary of medications appropriate for the repository and distribution program; (4) ensuring proper safety and management of medications collected by and maintained under the authority of a participating entity; and (5) ensuring the privacy of individuals for whom the medication was originally prescribed. Specifies criteria for medications to be donated, including that they: (1) not be adulterated, misbranded, or stored under conditions contrary to standards set by the United States Pharmacopoeia or the product manufacturer; (2) not have been in the possession of any patient or any individual member of the public, and (3) have been under the control of a staff member of a health or care facility who is licensed in California as a health care professional or has completed specified training requirements. Requires a pharmacist or physician at a participating entity to use his or her professional judgment in determining whether a medication is eligible for donation to the repository and distribution program."
"Existing law generally provides for the regulation of insurers by the Department of Insurance pursuant to laws set forth in the Insurance Code. Existing law authorizes the Insurance Commissioner to make certain examinations, investigations, and prosecutions and, upon making a determination of the existence of certain conduct, conditions, or grounds, to issue orders reasonably necessary to correct, eliminate, or remedy the conduct, conditions, or grounds.
Existing law exempts from the requirements set forth in the Insurance Code firemen’s, policemen’s, and peace officers’ benefit and relief associations that comply with specified criteria, including, among other things, a requirement that the membership consist solely of peace officers, members of police or fire departments, and emergency medical personnel employed by fire departments, as specified. Existing law prohibits an association from operating or doing business in the state without a certificate of authority.
This bill would require every association that holds a certificate of authority and that issues long-term disability or long-term care policies or contracts, as specified, to submit to the commissioner the opinion, as specified, of a qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items that support the policies or contracts issued are expected to be adequate to satisfy contractual provisions, are based on reasonable assumptions, and are based on specified actuarial standards. The bill would also require an association seeking a certificate of authority to file an opinion that meets specified requirements and that establishes that it would have adequate resources to provide benefits, as specified, as required to satisfy its proposed contractual obligations. The bill would recognize that information submitted by a company pursuant to those provisions and in the possession or control of the department as proprietary and containing trade secrets. The bill would require that information to be confidential and privileged, exempt from disclosure by the commissioner pursuant to the California Public Records Act, and not subject to subpoena or discovery from the commissioner or admissible into evidence in a private civil action if obtained from the commissioner. The bill would require the commissioner to notify the association of the deficiencies in the filing if the association fails to provide an opinion and supporting memoranda to the commissioner that meets the requirements of the bill, as specified. The bill would require an association that self-funds all or part of the benefits to include specified disclosure language in all contracts that are not regulated by the department and in certificates evidencing coverage under those contracts. The bill would also require the commissioner, if he or she determines that the laws governing these associations are inadequate to protect the interests of the members of the associations, to develop and deliver recommendations to the Assembly Committee on Insurance and the Senate Committee on Insurance regarding changes in the law necessary to protect the interests of members of the associations. The provisions of the bill would remain in effect only until December 31, 2018, and as of that date would be repealed.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 2, 2016.

The bill also exempts long-term policies or contracts issued by insurers that are admitted by the state to offer insurance products in the state from this reporting requirement. An association seeking a certificate of authority must file an opinion that establishes that it would have adequate resources to provide benefits described in this Act as required to satisfy its proposed contractual obligations. The opinion must be filed no later than July 1, 2016, and must include supporting memoranda from the same qualified actuary as to whether the reserves and related actuarial items held in support of the policies and contracts are expected to be adequate to satisfy contractual provisions, are based on reasonable assumptions, and are based on actuarial standards of practice published by the American Academy of Actuaries and the Actuarial Standards Board.

"The Pharmacy Law provides for the licensure and regulation of pharmacists by the California State Board of Pharmacy. That law requires a pharmacist to dispense a prescription in a container that, among other things, is correctly labeled with the directions for use of the drug, and requires the board to promulgate regulations that require, on or before January 1, 2011, a standardized, patient-centered, prescription drug label on all prescription medicine dispensed to patients in California. Existing regulations of the board implement that requirement, establishing standardized directions for use to be used when applicable, and requiring that the board publish on its Internet Web site translation of those directions for use into at least 5 languages other than English. A violation of that law is a crime.
This bill would require a pharmacist to use professional judgment to provide a patient with directions for use of a prescription that enhance the patient’s understanding of those directions, consistent with the prescriber’s instructions. The bill would also require a dispenser, excluding a veterinarian, upon the request of a patient or patient’s representative, to provide translated directions for use as prescribed. The bill would authorize a dispenser to use translations made available by the board pursuant to those existing regulations. The bill would make a dispenser responsible for the accuracy of English-language directions for use provided to the patient. By imposing new requirements on dispensers, the violation of which would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The Pharmacy Law also provides for the licensure and regulation of veterinary food-animal drug retailers by the board. That law subjects to specific prescription drug labeling requirements any veterinary food-animal drug dispensed pursuant to a prescription from a licensed veterinarian for food-producing animals from a veterinary food-animal drug retailer pursuant to that law.
This bill would also subject any veterinary food-animal drug so dispensed to the above drug labeling requirements relating to standardized directions for use.

"(1) The Hazardous Waste Control Law regulates the use and disposal of hazardous waste and authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control to deny, suspend, or revoke any permit, registration, or certificate applied for, or issued to, a person or entity if that person or entity engaged in specified activities in violation of the Hazardous Waste Control Law or other laws.
This bill would require the department to consider, except under specified circumstances, 3 or more violations of, or noncompliance with, specified provisions for which a person or entity has been found liable or has been convicted, with respect to a single hazardous waste facility within a 5-year period, as compelling cause to deny, suspend, or revoke a permit, registration, or certificate applied for by, or issued to, that person or entity.
(2) Existing law authorizes the department to temporarily suspend any permit, registration, or certificate prior to a hearing if the department determines that action is necessary to prevent or mitigate an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or safety or the environment. Existing law requires the department, upon receipt of a notice of defense to the accusation from the holder of the permit, registration, or certificate, to set the matter for hearing within 15 days and to hold the hearing as soon as possible, but not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice. Existing law requires the hearing to be held without delay and completed as soon as possible.
This bill would instead authorize the department to temporarily suspend any permit, registration, or certificate prior to a hearing if the department determines that conditions may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or safety or the environment. The bill would repeal the requirement that the hearing be held without delay and completed as soon as possible.
(3) Existing law provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties upon persons who violate the requirements of the hazardous waste control law or take other actions with regard to the handling of hazardous waste.
This bill would impose, upon a person who is subject to the imposition of those civil or criminal penalties, an additional civil penalty of not less than $5,000 or more than $50,000 for each day of each violation, if the person has been found liable for, or been convicted of, 2 or more previous violations of certain of these hazardous waste-related provisions within any consecutive 60 months.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2003.

The bill would require notice of a meeting to be given to an eligible person at least 4 days prior to the meetings. The bill would require a board of directors of a mutual water company to allow an eligible person to personally attend a meeting of the board, if the eligible person gave the board at least 24 hours advance written notice of his or her intent to personally attend the meeting. The bill would authorize the board to allow an eligible person who was denied attendance at a meeting for failure to provide this notice, or because the number of eligible persons having already provided notice of attendance exceeds the room capacity of the place of the meeting, to attend the meeting by teleconference, and would further require the board to provide to an eligible person attending a meeting by teleconference a copy of the documents to be discussed at the meeting, as specified.",".

The program awards grants on a competitive basis to counties that propose a project that provides, at a minimum, an education and training assessment for persons who are on probation, mandatory supervision, or postrelease community supervision and are supervised by, or under the jurisdiction of, a county. Existing law establishes criteria for the grant program, including that the education and training needs of both individuals who have some postsecondary education, and those who require basic education and training, are addressed. Existing law requires each project proposed in the application for a grant to include a provision for an education and training assessment for each individual of the supervised population who participates in the project, and provides that a prior assessment of an individual may be used if, in the determination of the State WIB, its results are accurate.

Existing law requires a seller of travel to deposit all sums received from any person or entity for air or sea transportation, or for any travel services offered by the seller of travel, and any refunds made by carries or providers of travel services, into a trust account, as specified. Existing law requires the seller of travel to file with the Attorney General an agreement allowing the Attorney General, a district attorney, or their representative to examine and obtain copies of all business records, including, but not limited to, those related to the trust account.
This bill would require the seller of travel to maintain all business records for a minimum period of 3 years. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to maintain an action for recovery of examination costs and expenses in any court of competent jurisdiction, as specified. The bill would require the seller of travel to pay for costs and expenses for any examination if the Attorney General bills the seller of travel, provided that the examination shows that the seller of travel has failed to comply with certain requirements.
Existing law creates the Travel Consumer Restitution Corporation, which assesses each registered seller of travel for both its operations and restitution funds. Existing law requires certain assessments to be due 45 days from the date the bill for that assessment is mailed.
This bill would instead require those assessments to be due 45 days from the date the bill for that assessment is sent to the seller of travel.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003.

"Under existing law, entities offering electric services in California are required to disclose information on the sources of energy that are used to provide electric services. Existing law requires every retail supplier, as defined, that makes an offer to sell electricity that is consumed in California to disclose its electricity sources for the previous calendar year. These disclosures are required to be made to end-use consumers and potential end-use consumers. Existing law requires a retail supplier to disclose its electricity sources as a percentage of annual sales that is derived from specified sources of energy, including eligible renewable energy resources. Existing law requires that retail suppliers annually report to the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission) certain information for each electricity offering from “specified sources,” as defined, for the previous calendar year and authorizes the Energy Commission to verify environmental claims made by retail suppliers.
This bill would, among other things, require the Energy Commission, in consultation with the State Air Resources Board, to adopt a methodology for the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions intensity for each purchase of electricity by a retail supplier to serve its retail customers. The bill would require a retail supplier, including an electrical corporation, local publicly owned electric utility, electric service provider, and community choice aggregator, to also disclose both the greenhouse gases emissions intensity of any electricity portfolio offered to its retail customers, as specified, and the Energy Commission’s calculation of the greenhouse gas emissions intensity associated with all statewide retail electricity sales. The bill would require a retail supplier to annually report to the Energy Commission certain additional information for each electricity offering for the previous calendar year and would authorize the Energy Commission to verify procurement claims, in addition to environmental claims, made by retail suppliers. The bill would require the Energy Commission, on or before January 1, 2018, to adopt guidelines, through an open process, subject to public comment, and adopted by a vote of the Energy Commission, for the reporting and disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions intensity. The bill would require retail suppliers, beginning June 1, 2020, to report data on greenhouse gas emissions intensity associated with retail sales occurring after December 31, 2018, except as provided.
The Public Utilities Act makes any public utility and any corporation other than a public utility guilty of a crime, if the public utility or corporation violates the act or fails to comply with any part of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission.
Because the provisions of this bill would be a part of the act and because a violation of an order or decision of the commission implementing its requirements by an electrical corporation or electric service provider would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding what is a crime. By placing additional reporting duties upon local publicly owned electric utilities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons.","Requires every retail supplier that makes an offering to sell electricity that is consumed in California to disclose its electricity sources and the associated greenhouse gases emissions intensity for the previous calendar year in all product-specific written promotional materials and by the end of the first complete billing cycle for the third quarter of the year.

Existing law authorizes specified classes and courses to be offered by school districts and county superintendents of schools for apportionment purposes from the adult education fund, including, among other subject matters, classes and courses for adult programs in parenting education.
Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law requires specified noncredit community college courses and classes to be eligible for program-based funding from the state, including, among other subject matters, parenting education courses and classes.

law requires the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the State Department of Education, pursuant to funding made available in the annual Budget Act, to jointly provide 2-year planning and implementation grants to regional consortia of community college districts and school districts for developing regional plans to better serve the educational needs of adults.
Existing law requires the grant funds provided under this program to be used by each regional consortium to create and implement a plan to better provide adults in its region with all of the following: elementary and secondary basic skills; classes and courses for immigrants eligible for educational services in citizenship and English as a second language, and workforce preparation classes in basic skills; education programs for adults with disabilities; short-term career technical education programs; and programs for apprentices.
This bill would
express the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to provide for both of the following: that the funding distributed to local educational agencies through adult education consortia, as described, continues to be available to pupils who are minors participating in high school credit recovery pursuant to designated provisions; and that no more than 10% of the apportionment received by a local educational agency for adult education will be used for pupils in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, as specified

To the extent that this bill would impose new duties on school districts and community college districts that participate in these regional consortia, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Makes specified noncredit classes and classes eligible for funding from the adult education fund: (1) parenting, including, but not necessarily limited to, parent cooperative preschools, and classes in child growth and development, parent-child relationships, and family literacy education, which may include support to children and school aged youth with limited English proficiency backgrounds in the households of participating adults; (2) elementary and secondary basic skills and other courses and classes required for the high school diploma; (3) adult education programs in English as a second language and workforce preparation classes in the basic skills of speaking, listening, reading, writing, mathematics, decisionmaking and problem solving skills, and other classes required for preparation to participate in job specific technical training; (4) adult education programs for immigrants eligible for educational services in citizenship, English as a second language, and workforce preparation classes in the basic skills of speaking, listening, reading, writing, mathematics, decisionmaking and problem solving skills, and other classes required for preparation to participate in job specific technical training; (5) adult short-term career technical education or programs in adult education; (6) adult education programs for older adults; (7) adult programs in home economics; (8) adult programs in health and safety education; and (9) adult programs in education programs for persons with substantial disabilities.

The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing law requires each county to establish a community child health and disability prevention program to include, among other things, health screening and evaluation services for all children that include immunizations and an assessment of immunization status.
This bill would require the State Department of Health Care Services to establish and administer the California Childhood Immunization Quality Improvement Fund (CCIQIF) program to improve childhood immunization rates, and would require the department to submit an application to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for a waiver to implement a 5-year demonstration project to implement the program. The bill would require the department to develop a plan for the collection and expenditure of CCIQIF moneys according to specified guidelines, including voluntary contributions from Medi-Cal managed care plans to be used for provider support payments and reward payments to Medi-Cal managed care plans, as specified. The bill would require the department to contract with specified researchers to develop and submit to the Legislature an evaluation of the effectiveness of the demonstration project. This bill would make these provisions inoperative on a specified date.",. (Sec. 1) This bill requires the state of California to establish and administer the California Childhood Immunization Quality Improvement Fund (CCIQIF) program to improve childhood immunization rates. The bill defines &quot;Medi-Cal managed care plan&quot; as any prepaid health plan or Medi-Cal managed care plan contracting with the state to provide services to enrolled Medi-Cal beneficiaries. The state must apply to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for a waiver or demonstration project to implement the CCIQIF program. The project shall operate for five years.
"Existing law establishes a workers’ compensation system, administered by the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers’ Compensation, to compensate an employee for injuries sustained in the course of employment. The administrative director is authorized to adopt, amend, or repeal, after public hearings, any rules and regulations that are reasonably necessary to enforce the state workers’ compensation provisions, except when that power is specifically reserved to the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board. Existing law requires the administrative director to adopt a medical treatment utilization schedule that addresses the frequency, duration, intensity, and appropriateness of all common treatments performed in workers’ compensation cases.
This bill would require the administrative director to establish a drug formulary, on or before July 1, 2017, as part of the medical treatment utilization schedule, for medications prescribed in the workers’ compensation system. The bill would require the administrative director to meet and consult with stakeholders, as specified, prior to the adoption of the formulary. The bill would require the administrative director to publish at least 2 interim reports on the Internet Web site of the Division of Workers’ Compensation describing the status of the creation of the formulary, commencing July 1, 2016, until the formulary is implemented. The bill would require the administrative director to update the formulary at least on a quarterly basis to allow for the provision of all appropriate medications, including medications new to the market. The bill would exempt an order updating the formulary from the Administrative Procedure Act and other provisions, as specified. The bill would require the administrative director to establish an independent pharmacy and therapeutics committee to review and consult with the administrative director in connection with updating the formulary, as specified. The bill would also make conforming changes to related code sections.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Labor Code, with respect to California workers compensation, to require the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers Compensation to adopt a drug formulary that includes: evidence-based guidelines for access to appropriate medications pursuant to pain management prescription drug therapies; guidance regarding how an injured worker may access off-label use of prescription drugs; the use of generic or generic-equivalent drugs in the formulary pursuant to evidence-based practices, with consideration given to use of brand name medication when its use is cost-effective, medically necessary, and evidence-based; and guidance on the use of the formulary to further the goal of providing appropriate medications while minimizing administrative burden and associated administrative costs. The bill exempts from these requirements a person or entity that dispenses medicines and medical supplies under a contract with an employer, group of self-insured employers, or group of insurers, or pharmacy benefit networks, if: (1) a generic drug equivalent is unavailable, or (2) the prescribing physician specifically provides in writing that a non-generic drug must be dispensed."
"Existing law, the Small Business Procurement and Contract Act, provides for various programs to encourage the participation of small businesses, as certified by the Department of General Services, in state agency contracts, including a microbusiness and a disabled veteran business enterprise. Existing law requires directors of state agencies, in awarding prescribed contracts, to provide a 5% preference to small businesses and microbusinesses, and a preference of up to 5% to a nonsmall business that provides for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation, not to exceed prescribed amounts. Existing law provides, in solicitations where an award is made to the lowest responsible bidder, that the preferences shall not exceed $50,000 for any bid and that the combined cost of preferences granted shall not exceed $100,000. Existing law provides that, in bids in which the state has reserved the right to make multiple awards, the $50,000 maximum preference cost shall be applied.
This bill would provide, in solicitations where an award is made to the lowest responsible bidder, that the preference to small business and microbusiness be 5% of the lowest responsible nonsmall business bidder meeting specifications and that the preference to nonsmall business bidders that provide for small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation be up to a maximum of 5% of the lowest responsible nonsmall business bidder. This bill also would provide that the preference not exceed $100,000 for any contract award and that the combined cost of preferences granted not exceed $150,000. This bill would require that the $100,000 maximum preference cost be applied in multiple contract awards.
Existing law, the Target Area Contract Preference Act, requires, if the contract is for goods or services in excess of $100,000, except as specified, the state to award preferences to California-based companies submitting bids or proposals for state contracts who demonstrate and certify under penalty of perjury that of the total labor hours required to manufacture the goods and perform the contract, at least a specified percentage of the hours will be accomplished at an identified worksite or worksites located in a distressed area by persons with a high risk of unemployment. Existing law also provides that the maximum preference and incentive a bidder may be awarded pursuant to this act is $50,000 for any bid, and $100,000 for the combined cost of these preferences and incentives and those provided pursuant to any other provision of law.
This bill would instead provide, if the bid includes preferences or incentives provided under the Target Area Contract Preference Act and the Small Business Procurement and Contract Act, that the maximum preference and incentive a bidder may be awarded pursuant to these provisions shall not exceed $150,000 for the combined cost of these preferences and incentives and those provided pursuant to any other provision of law.
Existing law, the California Tire Recycling Act, provides, on state purchases of products that are made of, or contains components that can be derived from the recycling of used tires, to suppliers of recycled tire products, a bid preference of 5% of the lowest bid or price quoted by suppliers offering similar products made from nonrecycled components. That law limits the preference to $100,000 each year, or $50,000 if the preference exceeding that amount would preclude an award to a small business that offers a similar product made of nonrecycled tire components and is qualified in accordance with the Small Business Procurement and Contract Act.
This bill would provide, notwithstanding those limitations, if the bid includes the preference authorized in the California Tire Recycling Act and the Small Business Procurement and Contract Act, the combined cost of preferences and incentives granted pursuant to California Tire Recycling Act and any other law is not to exceed $150,000.","Amends Federal law to increase the maximum small business bidder preference and incentive cost limits, respectively, for State contracts for the provision of goods, information technology, and services and in the construction of State facilities.

"Existing law, the School-based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services for Children Act of 1991, authorizes the Director of Health Care Services, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, to provide matching grants to local educational agencies to pay the state share of the costs of providing school-based early mental health intervention and prevention services to eligible pupils at schoolsites of eligible pupils, subject to the availability of funding each year. Existing law defines “eligible pupil” for this purpose as a pupil who attends a publicly funded elementary school and who is in kindergarten or grades 1 to 3, inclusive. Existing law also defines “local educational agency” as a school district or county office of education or a state special school.
This bill would expand the definition of an eligible pupil to include a pupil who attends a state preschool program at a publicly funded elementary school and a pupil who is in transitional kindergarten, thereby extending the application of the act to those persons. The bill would also include charter schools in the definition of local educational agency, thereby extending the application of the act to those entities. The bill would require the State Public Health Officer, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Schools and the Director of Health Care Services, to establish a 4-year pilot program, the School-Based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services Support Program, to provide outreach, free regional training, and technical assistance for local educational agencies in providing mental health services at schoolsites. The bill would require the State Department of Public Health to submit specified reports after 2 and 4 years. The bill would repeal these provisions as of January 1, 2021.","Requires the State Public Health Officer to establish a four-year pilot program to encourage local decisions to provide funding for eligible support services under the Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services for Children Program: (1) assisted with a pupil who attends a preschool program at a publicly funded elementary school, or who attends a publicly funded elementary school and who is in kindergarten, transitional kindergarten, or grades 1 to 3, inclusive transitional kindergarten; or (2) provided through a public or private agency.

"(1) Existing law generally prohibits the possession or transfer of assault weapons, except for the sale, purchase, importation, or possession of assault weapons by specified individuals, including law enforcement officers. Under existing law, “assault weapon” means, among other things, a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or a semiautomatic pistol that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and has any one of several specified attributes, including, for rifles, a thumbhole stock, and for pistols, a 2nd handgrip.
This bill would revise this definition of “assault weapon” to mean a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or a semiautomatic pistol that does not have a fixed magazine but has any one of those specified attributes. The bill would also define “fixed magazine” to mean an ammunition feeding device contained in, or permanently attached to, a firearm in such a manner that the device cannot be removed without disassembly of the firearm action.
By expanding the definition of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law requires that any person who, within this state, possesses an assault weapon, except as otherwise provided, be punished as a felony or for a period not to exceed one year in a county jail.
This bill would exempt from punishment under that provision a person who possessed an assault weapon prior to January 1, 2017, if specified requirements are met.
(3) Existing law requires that, with specified exceptions, any person who, prior to January 1, 2001, lawfully possessed an assault weapon prior to the date it was defined as an assault weapon, and which was not specified as an assault weapon at the time of lawful possession, register the firearm with the Department of Justice. Existing law permits the Department of Justice to charge a fee for registration of up to $20 per person but not to exceed the actual processing costs of the department. Existing law, after the department establishes fees sufficient to reimburse the department for processing costs, requires fees charged to increase at a rate not to exceed the legislatively approved annual cost-of-living adjustment for the department’s budget or as otherwise increased through the Budget Act. Existing law requires those fees to be deposited into the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account. Existing law, the Administrative Procedure Act, establishes the requirements for the adoption, publication, review, and implementation of regulations by state agencies.
This bill would require that any person who, from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2016, inclusive, lawfully possessed an assault weapon that does not have a fixed magazine, as defined, and including those weapons with an ammunition feeding device that can be removed readily from the firearm with the use of a tool, register the firearm with the Department of Justice before January 1, 2018, but not before the effective date of specified regulations. The bill would permit the department to increase the $20 registration fee as long as it does not exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. The bill would also require registrations to be submitted electronically via the Internet utilizing a public-facing application made available by the department. The bill would require the registration to contain specified information, including, but not limited to, a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely and specified information about the registrant. The bill would permit the department to charge a fee of up to $15 per person for registration through the Internet, not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department to be paid and deposited, as specified, for purposes of the registration program. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing those provisions and would exempt those regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would also make technical and conforming changes.

The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program requires the Public Utilities Commission to establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring all retail sellers, as defined, to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, at specified percentages of the total kilowatthours sold to their retail end-customers during specified compliance periods. The program additionally requires each local publicly owned electric utility, as defined, to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources to achieve the targets established by the program. The program, consistent with the goals of procuring the least-cost and best-fit eligible renewable energy resources that meet project viability principles, requires that all retail sellers procure a balanced portfolio of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as specified, referred to as the portfolio content requirements.
Existing law requires every electrical corporation to file with the commission a standard tariff for electricity generated by an electric generation facility, as defined, that qualifies for the tariff, is owned and operated by a retail customer of the electrical corporation, and is located within the service territory of, and developed to sell electricity to, the electrical corporation. This tariff requirement is known as the renewable feed-in tariff program. The program additionally requires the commission, by June 1, 2013, to direct the electrical corporations to collectively procure at least 250 megawatts of cumulative rated generating capacity from developers of bioenergy projects that commence operation on or after June 1, 2013. Pursuant to this requirement, the commission has established the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program.
This bill would provide that
unbundled
renewable energy credits may be used to meet the first category of the portfolio content requirements if (1) the credits are earned by electricity that is generated by an entity that, if it were a person or corporation, would be excluded from the definition of an electrical corporation by operation of the exclusions for a corporation or person employing landfill gas technology or digester gas technology, (2) the entity employing the landfill gas technology or digester gas technology has a first point of interconnection with a California balancing authority, a first point of interconnection with distribution facilities used to serve end users within a California balancing authority area, or

The bill would prohibit a public entity, selling renewable energy that is eligible to meet the first category of the portfolio content requirements pursuant to the bill’s provisions, from making any marketing or advertising claims regarding the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the renewable energy credit. The bill would require that the electricity generated that earned the renewable energy credit that is sold by the public entity be added to the total retail sales of the retail seller or local publicly owned electric utility purchasing the renewable energy credit for purposes of determining their renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 19, 2015.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 65850.7 is added to the Government Code, to read:
65850.7.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) The implementation of consistent statewide standards to achieve the timely and cost-effective installation of electric vehicle charging stations is not a municipal affair, as that term is used in Section 5 of Article XI of the California Constitution, but is instead a matter of statewide concern.
(2) It is the intent of the Legislature that local agencies not adopt ordinances that create unreasonable barriers to the installation of electric vehicle charging stations and not unreasonably restrict the ability of homeowners and agricultural and business concerns to install electric vehicle charging stations.
(3) It is the policy of the state to promote and encourage the use of electric vehicle charging stations and to limit obstacles to their use.
(4) It is the intent of the Legislature that local agencies comply not only with the language of this section, but also the legislative intent to encourage the installation of electric vehicle charging stations by removing obstacles to, and minimizing costs of, permitting for charging stations so long as the action does not supersede the building official’s authority to identify and address higher priority life-safety situations.
(b) A city, county, or city and county shall administratively approve an application to install electric vehicle charging stations through the issuance of a building permit or similar nondiscretionary permit. Review of the application to install an electric vehicle charging station shall be limited to the building official’s review of whether it meets all health and safety requirements of local, state, and federal law. The requirements of local law shall be limited to those standards and regulations necessary to ensure that the electric vehicle charging station will not have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety. However, if the building official of the city, county, or city and county makes a finding, based on substantial evidence, that the electric vehicle charging station could have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, the city, county, or city and county may require the applicant to apply for a use permit.
(c) A city, county, or city and county may not deny an application for a use permit to install an electric vehicle charging station unless it makes written findings based upon substantial evidence in the record that the proposed installation would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse impact. The findings shall include the basis for the rejection of potential feasible alternatives of preventing the adverse impact.
(d) The decision of the building official pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) may be appealed to the planning commission of the city, county, or city and county.
(e) Any conditions imposed on an application to install an electric vehicle charging station shall be designed to mitigate the specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety at the lowest cost possible.
(f) (1) An electric vehicle charging station shall meet applicable health and safety standards and requirements imposed by state and local permitting authorities.
(2) An electric vehicle charging station shall meet all applicable safety and performance standards established by the California Electrical Code, the Society of Automotive Engineers, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, and accredited testing laboratories such as Underwriters Laboratories and, where applicable, rules of the Public Utilities Commission regarding safety and reliability.
(g) (1) On or before September 30, 2016, every city, county, or city and county with a population of 200,000 or more residents, and, on or before September 30, 2017, every city, county, or city and county with a population of less than 200,000 residents, shall, in consultation with the local fire department or district and the utility director, if the city, county, or city and county operates a utility, adopt an ordinance, consistent with the goals and intent of this section, that creates an expedited, streamlined permitting process for electric vehicle charging stations. In developing an expedited permitting process, the city, county, or city and county shall adopt a checklist of all requirements with which electric vehicle charging stations shall comply to be eligible for expedited review. An application that satisfies the information requirements in the checklist, as determined by the city, county, or city and county, shall be deemed complete. Upon confirmation by the city, county, or city and county of the application and supporting documents being complete and meeting the requirements of the checklist, and consistent with the ordinance, a city, county, or city and county shall, consistent with subdivision (b), approve the application and issue all required permits or authorizations. However, the city, county, or city and county may establish a process to prioritize competing applications for expedited permits. Upon receipt of an incomplete application, a city, county, or city and county shall issue a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance. An application submitted to a city, county, or city and county that owns and operates an electric utility shall demonstrate compliance with the utility’s interconnection policies prior to approval.
(2) The checklist and required permitting documentation shall be published on a publicly accessible Internet Web site, if the city, county, or city and county has an Internet Web site, and the city, county, or city and county shall allow for electronic submittal of a permit application and associated documentation, and shall authorize the electronic signature on all forms, applications, and other documentation in lieu of a wet signature by an applicant. In developing the ordinance, the city, county, or city and county may refer to the recommendations contained in the most current version of the “Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Permitting Checklist” of the “Zero-Emission Vehicles in California: Community Readiness Guidebook” published by the Office of Planning and Research. A city, county, or city and county may adopt an ordinance that modifies the checklists and standards found in the guidebook due to unique climactic, geological, seismological, or topographical conditions. If a city, county, or city and county determines that it is unable to authorize the acceptance of an electronic signature on all forms, applications, and other documents in lieu of a wet signature by an applicant, the city, county, or city and county shall state, in the ordinance required under this subdivision, the reasons for its inability to accept electronic signatures and acceptance of an electronic signature shall not be required.
(h) A city, county, or city and county shall not condition approval for any electric vehicle charging station permit on the approval of an electric vehicle charging station by an association, as that term is defined in Section 4080 of the Civil Code.
(i) The following definitions shall apply to this section:
(1) “A feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse impact” includes, but is not limited to, any cost-effective method, condition, or mitigation imposed by a city, county, or city and county on another similarly situated application in a prior successful application for a permit.
(2) “Electronic submittal” means the utilization of one or more of the following:
(A) Email.
(B) The Internet.
(C) Facsimile.
(3) “Electric vehicle charging station” or “charging station” means any level of electric vehicle supply equipment station that is designed and built in compliance with Article 625 of the California Electrical Code, as it reads on the effective date of this section, and delivers electricity from a source outside an electric vehicle into a plug-in electric vehicle.
(4) “Specific, adverse impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, and written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete.
SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because a local agency or school district has the authority to levy service charges, fees, or assessments sufficient to pay for the program or level of service mandated by this act, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code.","This bill requires a city, county, or city and county to administratively approve an application to install electric vehicle charging stations through the issuance of a building permit or similar nondiscretionary permit, review of such application shall be limited to whether it meets all health and safety requirements of local, state, and federal law, and the requirements of local law shall be limited to those standards and regulations necessary to ensure that such stations will not have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety. The requirements of local law shall be limited to those standards and regulations necessary to ensure that such stations will not have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety. If a building official makes a finding that such a station could have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, the city, county, or city and county may require the applicant to apply for a use permit. A city, county, or city and county may not deny an application for a use permit to install such a station unless it makes written findings based upon substantial evidence in the record that the proposed installation would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily or avoid the adverse impact. The findings shall include the basis for the rejection of"
"Existing law establishes the State Department of State Hospitals for the administration of state hospitals and provides for the involuntary confinement of certain individuals in those state hospitals, including a defendant who has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial or who has been found to be insane at the time he or she committed the crime. Existing law requires a court, when a defendant pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, or if there is a question as to the defendant’s mental competence, to appoint a specified number of psychiatrists or psychologists to examine the defendant.
This bill would require the State Department of State Hospitals to establish, within the department, a pool of psychiatrists and psychologists with forensic skills, and would require the department to create evaluation panels from the pool of psychiatrists and psychologists, as specified. The bill would require the court to order an evaluation panel to evaluate a defendant who pleads not guilty by reason of insanity or who may be mentally incompetent. The bill would also make conforming changes.","Amends the Penal Code to require, when a defendant pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, that the court select and appoint two, and may select and appoint three psychiatrists, or licensed psychologists who have a doctoral degree in and at least five years of experience in the diagnosis and treatment of emotional and mental disorders, to appoint an evaluation panel to examine the defendant and investigate his or her mental status. Specifies that: (1) any report on the examination and investigation made pursuant to this Act shall include, but not be limited to, the defendant's psychological history; and (2) it is the duty of the psychiatrists or psychologists selected and appointed to make the examination and investigation, and to testify, whenever in any proceeding in which the sanity of the defendant is in question."
"(1) Existing law requires each school district or county superintendent of schools maintaining kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, to provide one nutritionally adequate free or reduced-price meal for each needy pupil during each schoolday, except as specified. Existing law authorizes a school district or county office of education to use funds made available through any applicable federal or state program or to use its own funds to provide the required meals.
This bill would express legislative findings and declarations relating to the federal School Breakfast Program.
The bill, from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, inclusive, would require each school district or county office of education maintaining any kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, to make a nutritionally adequate breakfast available for all of the pupils in a school, when at least 40% of the pupils enrolled at the school are needy children, as defined. On and after July 1, 2017, these requirements would apply only to schools where at least 40%, but less than 60%, of the pupils enrolled in that school are needy children.
The bill, from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018, inclusive, with respect to schools where at least 60% of the pupils enrolled at the school are needy children, would additionally require these nutritionally adequate breakfasts to be available to pupils after instruction has begun for the schoolday, as defined. On and after July 1, 2018, these requirements would apply only to schools where at least 60%, but less than 80%, of the pupils enrolled in that school are needy children.
The bill, on and after July 1, 2018, with respect to schools where at least 80% of the pupils enrolled at the school are needy children, would additionally require these nutritionally adequate breakfasts to be available to pupils, at no cost to the pupil, after instruction has begun for the schoolday, as defined.
The bill would also specify that these provisions shall not be construed to require a school to set aside instructional time for the purpose of serving breakfast.
To the extent that this bill would create new duties for school districts and county offices of education, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill amends the Education Code to require a school district or county office of education maintaining any kindergarten or any of grades one to 12 to provide each pupil who is a needy child with one nutritionally adequate free or reduced-price meal during each schoolday, except that family day care homes that are reimbursed for 75% of the meals served may use funds available through any federal or state program for the provision of meals to a pupil, including the federal School Breakfast Program, the federal National School Lunch Program, the federal Summer Food Service Program, the federal Seamless Summer Option, or the state meal program. Each school district or county office of education maintaining any kindergarten or any of grades one to 12 shall provide breakfast for its pupils from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017, inclusive, if at least 40% of the pupils enrolled are needy children. This breakfast may be offered either for sale or at no cost to the pupils. No pupil shall be required to consume a meal after the time the schoolday has begun for a majority of the pupils enrolled."
"(1) Existing law establishes the Department of Water Resources in the Natural Resources Agency, and, among other things, empowers the department to conduct investigations of all or any portion of any stream, stream system, lake, or other body of water.
Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
This bill would require the department to increase statewide water storage capacity by 25% by January 1, 2025, and 50% by January 1, 2050, as specified. The bill would require the department, on or before January 1, 2017, to identify the current statewide water storage capacity and prepare a strategy and implementation plan to achieve those expansions in statewide water storage capacity, and would require the department to update the strategy and implementation plan on January 1, 2018, and every 2 years thereafter, until January 1, 2050. The bill would require the Legislative Analyst’s Office to report to the Legislature on January 1, 2020, and every 5 years thereafter, until January 1, 2050, on the department’s progress on achieving those required increases in statewide water storage capacity, as specified. The bill would, beginning in the 2016–17 fiscal year, continuously appropriate 25% of the annual proceeds of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to the department to comply with these requirements.
Existing
(2) Existing
law establishes the State Water Resources Control Board and the 9 California regional water quality control boards as the principal state agencies with authority over matters relating to water quality. Existing law requires the state board to formulate and adopt state policy for water quality control. Existing law requires each regional board to formulate and adopt water quality control plans for all areas within the region and prohibits a water quality control plan, or a revision of the plan, adopted by a regional board, from becoming effective unless it is approved by the state board.
Existing law, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, requires all groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins by the Department of Water Resources that are designated as basins subject to critical conditions of overdraft to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2020, and requires all other groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2022, except as specified.
This bill would require the state board, in formulating state policy for water quality control and adopting or approving a water quality control plan for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, to take into consideration, consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, any applicable groundwater sustainability plan or alternative and available information and data regarding the impacts of groundwater use and management on beneficial uses of surface waters.",". The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Health and Safety Code to mandate that 35% of proceeds from the California Water Storage Fund be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that 25% of such proceeds be used for: transit, affordable housing, and sustainable communities programs; the Transportation Agency for the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program; the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program; the Strategic Growth Council for the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program; and the High-Speed Rail Authority for the initial operating segment and Phase I Blended System as described in the 2012 business plan. With respect to the repayment of loans made to the Department of Water Resources under the Water Storage and Reliability Fund, the bill requires: (1) the Department to identify the current statewide water storage capacity calculation in specified subdivisions; (2) the Department to prepare a strategy and implementation plan to achieve an expansion of statewide water storage capacity of 25% by January 1, 2025, and 50% by January 1, 2050; and (3) the Department to update such strategy and plan every two years."
"(1) The California Public Records Act requires that public records be open to inspection at all times during the office hours of a state or local agency and that every person has a right to inspect any public record, except as specifically provided. The act further requires that a reasonably segregable portion of a public record be available for inspection by any person requesting the public record after deletion of the portions that are exempted by law.
This bill would, notwithstanding any other law, prohibit the disclosure of a recording made by a body worn camera, as defined, except for requiring disclosure to the person whose image is recorded by the body worn camera.
(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
(3) The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law provides that peace officer or custodial officer personnel records and records maintained by any state or local agency, or information obtained from these records, are confidential and shall not be disclosed in any criminal or civil proceeding except by discovery. Existing law describes exceptions to this policy, including data regarding the number, type, or disposition of complaints made against officers if that information is in a form that does not identify the individuals involved.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.","This bill amends the Penal Code, with respect to the use of body-worn cameras by law enforcement officers, to prohibit a recording made by a body-worn camera from being disclosed to the person whose image is recorded. Body-worn cameras are devices attached to the uniform or body of a peace officer that records video, audio, or both, in a digital or analog format."
"Existing law, operative January 1, 2016, provides that the gross weight on any one axle of a bus shall not exceed 20,500 pounds. Existing law exempts from this limitation a transit bus procured through a solicitation process pursuant to which a solicitation was issued before January 1, 2013. A violation of this provision is a crime.
This bill would exempt from the weight limitation transit buses procured through a solicitation process pursuant to which a solicitation was issued before January 1, 2016. The bill would provide that the weight limitation would not apply to a bus purchased during an option period in a multiyear contract to purchase transit buses that is entered into before January 1, 2016, by a publicly owned or operated transit system, or an operator of a transit system under contract with a publicly owned or operated transit system, provided that the option period does not exceed 5 years from the date of the original contract, or extend beyond January 1, 2021, whichever is earlier. This bill would also establish certain weight limitations for transit buses procured through a solicitation process pursuant to which a solicitation was issued at a specified time. The bill would provide that these provisions do not authorize the operation of a transit bus on a bridge or certain other structures if the gross weight of the transit bus is greater than the maximum weight which the bridge or other structure can safely sustain. The bill would require, if the gross weight imposed upon the highway by the wheels on any one axle of a transit bus exceeds 20,000 pounds, the axle to be supported by 4 wheels bearing load upon the highway. Because a violation of these provisions would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require a transit operator operating an articulated bus to provide notice, by July 1, 2016, to all cities and counties in whose jurisdiction the bus will operate in the upcoming calendar year, of the approximate routes upon which the bus will operate. The bill would also require an annual notice by July 1 thereafter to all cities and counties under whose jurisdiction the bus will operate, identifying any changes to the service on those routes or any new routes upon which the bus is expected to be scheduled for the upcoming calendar year.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Vehicle Code, as amended by the Statutes of 2014, to reduce the maximum gross weight on any one axle of a bus to 20,500 pounds. The maximum curb weight on any one axle of a transit bus shall not exceed 23,000 pounds. The curb weight on any one axle of: (1) an articulated transit bus or zero-emission transit bus procured through a solicitation process between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, shall not exceed 25,000 pounds; and (2) an articulated transit bus or zero-emission transit bus procured through a solicitation process between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, shall not exceed 22,000 pounds. The bill defines &quot;curb weight&quot; as the total weight of a fully loaded transit bus, including maximum fuel, oil, and coolant, and all equipment used in the normal operation of the bus, except without passengers or a driver."
"Existing law establishes the Medi-Cal program, administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which health care services are provided to qualified, low-income persons. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing law provides, to the extent permitted by federal law, that adult day health care (ADHC) be excluded from coverage under the Medi-Cal program.
This bill would establish the Community-Based Adult Services (CBAS) program as a Medi-Cal benefit and would require CBAS to be available as a covered service in contracts with managed health care plans, as specified. The bill would specify eligibility requirements for participation in the CBAS program. The bill would require that CBAS providers be licensed as ADHC centers and certified by the California Department of Aging as CBAS providers. The bill would require CBAS providers to meet specified licensing requirements and to provide care in accordance with specified regulations. The bill would require that these provisions be implemented only if federal financial participation is available.","This bill declares that California supports the dignity, independence, and choice of seniors and persons with disabilities to live in the most integrated setting appropriate in their own home or community-based setting and to be free from unnecessary institutionalization. A program of the Department of Health and Human Services under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSAct) that provides home health and other services for older adults and persons with disabilities is established in California as a service designed to meet the needs of older adults and adults with disabilities in community settings rather than in institutional care."
"Existing law, the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, establishes a program of cooperative federalism for the regulation of telecommunications to attain the goal of local competition, while implementing specific, predictable, and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service, consistent with certain universal service principles. The universal service principles include the principle that consumers in all regions of the nation, including low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high-cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services, that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas. The act authorizes each state to adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within the state, only to the extent that they adopt additional specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms that do not rely on or burden federal universal service support mechanisms.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including telephone corporations, as defined. Existing law establishes the California Advanced Services Fund, referred to as the CASF, in the State Treasury. Existing law requires the commission to develop, implement, and administer the CASF to encourage deployment of high-quality advanced communications services to all Californians that will promote economic growth, job creation, and substantial social benefits of advanced information and communications technologies, as provided in specified decisions of the commission and in the CASF statute. Existing law establishes 4 accounts, the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account, the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account, the Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan Account, and the Broadband Public Housing Account within the CASF. Existing law requires that of the moneys collected for CASF on and after January 1, 2011, $10,000,000 is to be deposited into the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account and used for specified purposes, and $15,000,000 is to be deposited into the Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan Account and used for specified purposes.
This bill would require that of the moneys collected for CASF on and after January 1, 2011, $15,000,000 is to be deposited into the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account and used for specified purposes, and $10,000,000 is to be deposited into the Broadband Infrastructure Revolving Loan Account and used for specified purposes.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Public Utilities Code to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop, implement, and administer the California Advanced Services Fund program to encourage deployment of high-quality advanced communications services to all Californians that will promote economic growth, job creation, and the substantial social benefits of advanced information and communications technologies. (Sec. 2) States that the goal of the program is to approve funding for infrastructure projects that will provide broadband access to no less than 98% of California households.<n><n>Directs the FCC, in approving infrastructure projects, to give priority to projects that provide last-mile broadband access to households that are unserved by an existing facilities-based broadband provider. Requires the FCC to provide each applicant, and any party challenging an application, the opportunity to demonstrate actual levels of broadband service in the project area.<n><n>Directs the FCC to establish the following accounts within the fund: (1) the Broadband Infrastructure Grant Account; (2) the Rural and Urban Regional Broadband Consortia Grant Account; and (3) the Broadband Public Housing Account. Requires all moneys collected by the surcharge authorized by the FCC pursuant to Decision 07-12-054 to be transmitted to the FCC pursuant to a schedule established by the FCC. Requires the commission to transfer the moneys received to the Controller"
"Existing law imposes specified requirements on manufacturers of motor vehicles sold or leased in this state. Existing law requires hospitals to make reasonable efforts to contact the agent, surrogate, or family of patients who are otherwise incapable of communication.
This bill would enact the “Motor Vehicle Emergency Contact Locator Act of 2015” and would require a vehicle identification number emergency contact locator database to be established by motor vehicle manufacturers in conjunction with law enforcement agencies and the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System.
This bill would require a motor vehicle manufacturer of a new motor vehicle sold or leased in this state on or after January 2, 2016, with a 2017 model year or later, to provide a means by which a purchaser or lessee of a new motor vehicle can voluntarily designate at the original retail point of sale an emergency contact to be stored in the VinECON database.
The bill would require the emergency contact information to be made available electronically only to authorized law enforcement and would require law enforcement personnel, when practicable, to expeditiously provide any VinECON data, either verbal or written, to the emergency department of a general acute care hospital receiving a motor vehicle crash victim who is unconscious or otherwise incapable of communication, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program by imposing new duties upon local agencies.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Declares the intent of the Legislature in enacting this Act to increase the registration benefits of the Business Partner Automation Program by allowing a purchaser or lessee of a motor vehicle sold or leased in this state on or after January 2, 2016, with a 2017 model year or later notice, to allow a purchaser or lessee to voluntarily register in the National Law Enforcement Vehicle Emergency Contact Locator (ECON) database using electronic programs provided by a qualified private industry partner dealer. This Act shall apply only to vehicles sold or leased on or after January 2, 2016, with a 2017 model year or later notice, to assist police to expeditiously provide information to an emergency department of a general acute care hospital receiving a motor vehicle crash victim who is unconscious or otherwise incapable of communication."
"The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) generally requires all state and local governmental lead agencies to prepare, or cause to be prepared by contract, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on any discretionary project that they propose to carry out or approve that may result in a significant effect on the environment, that is, a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the physical conditions that exist within the area that will be affected by the project.

"Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of various healing arts practitioners by boards within the Department of Consumer Affairs.
Existing law defines “unfair competition” to mean and include any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising. Under existing law, a person who engages in unfair competition is liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500 for each violation.
Existing law establishes the State Department of Public Health and sets forth its powers and duties over the regulation of health facilities and adult day health care centers, including, but not limited to, adopting regulations setting forth applicable staffing standards. Existing regulations of the department applicable to intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled and for adult day health care centers define “music therapist” as a person who has a bachelor’s degree in music therapy and who is registered or eligible for registration by the National Association for Music Therapy, now known as the American Music Therapy Association.
This bill would prohibit a person who provides music therapy, as defined, from using the title of “Board Certified Music Therapist” unless the person has completed specified education and clinical training requirements. The bill would also establish that it is an unfair business practice for a person to use the title “Board Certified Music Therapist” if he or she does not meet those requirements. The bill would prohibit its provisions from being construed to authorize a person engaged in music therapy to state or imply that he or she provides mental health counseling, psychotherapy, or occupational therapy for which a license is required and provide that use of music therapy shall not imply or suggest that the person is a Board Certified Music Therapist, if he or she does not meet specified criteria.",".

The bill grants the Music Therapist-Board Certified credential to music therapists who have demonstrated the knowledge, skills, and abilities for competence in the current practice of music therapy. The purpose of the board certification is to provide an objective national standard that can be used as a measure of professionalism and competence by interested agencies, groups, and individuals.

This bill would require 4 of the 13 members of the council to be Members of the Legislature who are to be considered a joint committee of the 2 houses of the Legislature constituted and acting as an investigating committee.
This bill would authorize the council, on its own motion, to make reports and recommendations to assist the Legislature and Governor in respect to the holistic impact of all levels of state and local regulations on specific industries operating within the state. This bill would deem the council to be within the executive branch of state government, but prohibit the council from being subject to the control or direction of any officer or employee of the executive branch, except in connection with the appropriation of funds approved by the Legislature.

"Existing law, the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937, authorizes counties to establish retirement systems, as specified, in order to provide pension benefits to county, city, and district employees. Existing law defines a district for these purposes and includes specified county retirement systems within the definition.
This bill would include the retirement system established under these provisions in the County of Ventura within the definition of district.
The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 also authorizes the board of retirement, in a county in which the board has appointed administrative, technical, and clerical staff personnel, to also appoint other administrators, managers, and legal counsel, as specified. These appointees are not classified as county employees and are therefor not subject to the civil service system, but are employees of the retirement system subject to the terms of employment determined by the board of retirement.
This bill would authorize the board of retirement of Ventura County to appoint a retirement administrator, chief financial officer, chief operations officer, chief investment officer, and general counsel. The bill would require these appointees to be employees of the retirement system, and not of the county, and subject to terms and conditions of employment established by the board of retirement. The bill would provide that the compensation of these appointees is an expense of the administration of the retirement system. The bill would grant the board of retirement and the board of supervisors authority to enter into agreements necessary to implement its provisions and would except the retirement system from specified requirements relating to retirement administrators. The bill would provide that these provisions apply to the Ventura County retirement system only upon adoption of a specified resolution by the board of retirement. The bill would make conforming changes.","Directs the people of California to establish a retirement system for employees of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, including employees of a new public agency created on February 1, 1977, as well as employees of Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties."
"The California Constitution provides that the civil service includes every officer and employee in the state except as otherwise provided in the Constitution. Existing law, the State Civil Service Act, however, permits the use of personal services contracts by state agencies if specified conditions are met. In this regard, a state agency may use a personal service contract to achieve cost savings if, among other conditions, the contract does not cause the displacement, as defined, of civil service employees. Existing law also permits the use of personal services contracts in response to particular conditions, including during emergencies, if the contract is for a new state function and the Legislature has mandated or authorized the performance of work by independent contractors, or to protect against a conflict of interest, among others.
This bill would make the use of personal services contracts in response to particular conditions, as described above, conditional on the contract not causing the displacement, as defined, of civil service employees.","Revises provisions regarding the use of personal services contracts to require that: (1) a contracting agency clearly demonstrates that the proposed contract will result in actual overall cost savings to the state; (2) proposals to contract out work shall not be approved solely on the basis that savings will result from lower contractor pay rates or benefits; (3) the contract does not cause the displacement of civil service employees; (4) the contract is awarded through a publicized, competitive bidding process and includes specific provisions pertaining to the qualifications of the staff and assurance that the contractor has specifically mandated or authorized the performance of the work by independent contractors; (5) the potential economic risk to the state from potential contractor rate increases is minimal; (6) the contract is exempted with a firm advantage; and (7) the legislative, administrative, or legal goals and purposes cannot be accomplished through the utilization of persons selected pursuant to the regular civil service system.

The act does not apply to claims for reimbursement for health care services provided under the Medi-Cal program, unless the Medi-Cal health care services provider is a small business or nonprofit organization. The act defines the terms “small business” and “nonprofit organization,” in reference to providers under the Medi-Cal program, to mean a business or organization that meets specified criteria, including that, except as specified, together with any affiliates, the business or organization has gross receipts from business operations that do not exceed $3,000,000 per year.
This bill would make a nonsubstantive change to this provision.
This bill would increase that gross receipts maximum to $4,000,000.","Makes it the intent of the Legislature that state agencies pay properly submitted, invoices, refunds, or other undisputed payments due to individuals within 45 days of receipt or notification thereof, or automatically calculate and pay the appropriate late payment penalties as specified in this Act.

"The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act contains various provisions regulating the application for, the issuance of, the suspension of, and the conditions imposed upon, alcoholic beverage licenses by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Existing law provides for various annual fees for the issuance of alcoholic beverage licenses, depending upon the type of license issued.
This bill, the Craft Distillers Act of 2015, would authorize the department to issue a craft distiller’s license to manufacture distilled spirits, subject to specified conditions, including that the licensee manufacture no more than 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per fiscal year, excluding brandy the craft distiller manufactures or has manufactured for them. The bill would allow the craft distiller’s licensee to sell distilled spirits to specified consumers, to own interests in on-sale retail licenses, and to sell beer, wines, brandies, and distilled spirits to consumers for consumption on the premises of a bona fide eating place, as provided. The bill would impose an original fee and an annual renewal fee for the license, which would be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund.
The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act authorizes a licensed distilled spirits manufacturer to conduct tastings of distilled spirits produced or bottled by, or produced or bottled for, the licensee, on the licensed premises, under specified conditions, including that tasting not be given in the form of a cocktail or mixed drink.
This bill would extend that authorization to a licensed craft distiller and would revise the tasting conditions by allowing a tasting to be given in the form of a cocktail or mixed drink.
Existing law prohibits a distilled spirits manufacturer’s or distilled spirits manufacturer’s agent’s license from being held by a person that holds any ownership or interest in any distilled spirits wholesaler’s, rectifier’s, or retailer’s license, as specified.

The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.) Crafts Licenses Act of 2015 (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Business and Professions Code, with respect to the sale of distilled spirits in California, to authorize a distilled spirits manufacturer or craft licensee to conduct such sales on or off the licensee's premises only for an event sponsored by a nonprofit organization, subject to specified conditions. A distilled manufacturer shall not sell or solicit sales of such spirits at an event. The nonprofit organization shall first obtain a permit from the Department of Justice (DOJ). The bill prohibits a person under 21 years of age from serving distilled spirits on the licensee's premises. A licensee may charge for conducted distilled spirits without charge for any brandy. The bill exempts from such license requirements craft distillers that have begun to operate pursuant to an original craft license license issued pursuant to this bill. The fee for such a license shall be adjusted annually to reflect the three-tier system of licensing, while excluding the annual license fee for craft brandy warehouse receipts.

"Existing law authorizes any person who meets specified requirements to circulate an initiative petition to be presented to the voters at a municipal, county, or special district election. Existing law requires the elections official to examine the petitions, and from the records of registration ascertain whether or not the petition is signed by the requisite number of voters. If the petition is found sufficient, the elections official is required to certify the results of the examination to the appropriate legislative body.
This bill would additionally require the elections official to immediately place the initiative measure on the election ballot for which it qualifies if the official finds the petition to be sufficient. If more than one election date is legally possible, the official would be required to place the measure on the ballot for the earliest legally possible date, unless as specified. The bill would apply this procedure to municipal, county, and district initiative measures, including city and city and county charter proposals, and to municipal referendum measures. The bill also would make a technical change.
By imposing new requirements on local elections officials, the bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(Sec. 2) Requires the elections official, within 30 days from the date of filing of a petition, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, to examine the petition, and from the records of registration ascertain whether or not the petition is signed by the requisite number of voters.

"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Existing law provides that specialty mental health services and Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) for any individual under 21 years of age are covered under Medi-Cal, consistent with the requirements of federal law. Federal law defines EPSDT to include screening services, vision services, dental services, hearing services, and other necessary services to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not the services are covered under the state plan. Existing law provides that specialty mental health services include EPSDT services provided to eligible Medi-Cal beneficiaries under 21 years of age.
Existing law requires each local mental health plan to establish a procedure to ensure access to outpatient specialty mental health services, as required by the EPSDT program standards, for children in foster care who have been placed outside their county of adjudication. Existing law includes standardized contracts, procedures, documents, and forms, to facilitate the receipt of medically necessary specialty mental health services by a foster child who is placed outside his or her county of original jurisdiction.
This bill would declare the intent of the Legislature to ensure that foster children who are placed outside of their county of original jurisdiction, are able to access mental health services in a timely manner consistent with their individualized strengths and needs and the requirements of EPSDT program standards and requirements. The bill would require the department to issue policy guidance that establishes the conditions for and exceptions to presumptive transfer of responsibility for providing or arranging for mental health services to a foster child from the county of original jurisdiction to the county in which the foster child resides, as prescribed. The bill would define presumptive transfer for these purposes. The bill would authorize any interested party who owes a legal duty to the child involving the child’s health or welfare to seek a waiver of presumptive transfer and would provide that the county probation agency or child welfare services agency with responsibility for the care and placement of the child is responsible for determining whether presumptive transfer is appropriate under specified conditions, including when a determination is made that the transfer of mental health services would disrupt continuity of care or timely access to services, as specified. The bill would require the mental health plan in the host county to assume responsibility for the authorization and provision of mental health services, and payments for services, upon the presumptive transfer. By increasing the responsibilities of county probation agencies or child welfare services agencies with respect to determining whether presumptive transfer is appropriate, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would require the department to seek approval from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) prior to implementing these provisions if the department determines that approval is necessary. The bill would authorize the department and the State Department of Social Services to adopt regulations to implement these provisions by July 1, 2019, as specified.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Prohibits a mental health plan that is not administered by a county from transferring the obligation for any mental health services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries to the county, except to the extent prior federal approval is received.

"Existing law, the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, provides that a change in voting procedures may not take effect in a state or political subdivision that is covered by the preclearance requirements of the federal act until the change is approved by a specified federal authority. A state or political subdivision is covered by the preclearance requirements of the federal act if it maintained a specified test or device as a prerequisite to voting, and had low voter registration or turnout, in the 1960s and early 1970s. The federal act allows a state or political subdivision covered by the act to obtain an exemption from the preclearance requirements if it satisfies specified criteria. The United States Supreme Court has held that the coverage formula of the federal act is unconstitutional and may not be used as a basis for requiring a jurisdiction to subject a proposed change in voting procedures to federal preclearance. Before that holding, the Counties of Kings, Monterey, and Yuba were covered jurisdictions subject to the federal preclearance requirements.
This bill would establish a state preclearance system. Under this system, if a covered political subdivision, as defined, enacts or seeks to administer a voting-related law, regulation, or policy, as specified, that is different from that in force or effect on the date this act is enacted, the governing body of the covered political subdivision would be required to submit the law, regulation, or policy to the Secretary of State for approval. The bill would require the Secretary of State to approve the law, regulation, or policy only if specified conditions are met. The bill would provide that the law, regulation, or policy will not take effect or be administered in the covered political subdivision until the law, regulation, or policy is approved by the Secretary of State, except as specified. The bill would allow the governing body of the covered political subdivision to seek review of the Secretary of State’s decision by means of an action filed in the Superior Court of Sacramento.
By requiring local governments to seek approval of the Secretary of State for changes to voting procedures, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill amends the Elections Code to ensure that the right of California citizens to vote is not denied or abridged on account of race, color, or language minority status through the enforcement of a voting-related law, regulation, or policy that is enacted or administered after this bill's enactment date.

"(1) The Subdivision Map Act vests the authority to regulate and control the design and improvement of subdivisions in the legislative body of a local agency, and sets forth procedures governing the local agency’s processing, approval, conditional approval or disapproval, and filing of tentative, final, and parcel maps, and the modification thereof. The act generally requires a subdivider to file a tentative map or vesting tentative map with the local agency, as specified, and the local agency, in turn, to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the map within a specified time period. The act requires an approved tentative map or vesting tentative map to expire 24 months after its approval, or after an additional period of time prescribed by local ordinance, not to exceed 12 months. However, the act extends the expiration date of certain approved tentative maps and vesting tentative maps, as specified.
This bill would extend by 24 months the expiration date of any approved tentative map or vesting tentative map that was approved on or after January 1, 2002, and not later than July 11, 2013, within a county that meets certain criteria, except as specified. The bill would additionally require the extension of an approved or conditionally approved tentative map or vesting tentative map, or parcel map for which a tentative map or vesting tentative map was approved on or before December 31, 2001, upon application by the subdivider at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the map, as specified. By adding to the procedures that local agency officials must follow, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) The Permit Streamlining Act prohibits a local agency, after its approval of a tentative map for a subdivision of single- or multiple-family residential units, from requiring conformance with, or the performance of, any conditions that the local agency could have lawfully imposed as a condition to the previously approved tentative or parcel map, as a condition to the issuance of any building permit or equivalent permit upon approval of that subdivision, during a 5-year period following the recordation of the final map or parcel map for that subdivision. The act also prohibits a local agency from refusing to issue a building permit or equivalent permit for a subdivider’s failure to conform with or perform those conditions. However, the act also provides that this 5-year period is a 3-year period for a tentative map extended pursuant to a specified provision of law, and the local agency is not prohibited from levying a fee, or imposing a condition that requires the payment of a fee upon the issuance of a building permit, with respect to the underlying units.
This bill would provide that a tentative map extended pursuant to its provisions is also subject to the truncated 3-year period described above, and that the local agency is not prohibited from levying a fee, as specified, or imposing a condition that requires the payment of a fee upon the issuance of a building permit, with respect to the underlying units. By adding to the procedures that local agency officials must follow, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(4) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","Prohibits a city, county, or city and county from requiring as a condition to the issuance of any building permit or equivalent permit for a subdivision of single- or multiple-family residential units, upon approval or conditional approval of a tentative map for such a subdivision for which no tentative map was required, during the five-year period following recordation of the final map or parcel map for the subdivision, conformance with or the performance of any conditions that the city, county, or city and county could have lawfully imposed as a condition to the previously approved tentative or parcel map. Extends, for three years, the period during which such a condition may be imposed."
"Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to look through a hole or opening, into, or to view, by means of any instrumentality, the interior of an area in which an occupant has a reasonable expectation of privacy with the intent to invade the privacy of that person. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to record another person under or through the clothing worn by that person, without the consent or knowledge of the person, under circumstances in which the person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to secretly record another person in a state of full or partial undress without the consent or knowledge of that person, in an area in which that person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to intentionally distribute an image of the intimate body part or parts of another person, or an image of the person depicted engaging in specified sexual acts, under circumstances in which the persons agree or understand that the image remain private, the person distributing the image knows or should know that distribution of the image will cause serious emotional distress, and the person depicted suffers that distress.
Existing law establishes the proper jurisdictions of a criminal action for unauthorized use, retention, or transfer of personal identifying information to include the county where the theft occurred, the county in which the victim resided at the time of the offense, or the county where the information was used for an illegal purpose.
This bill would apply those jurisdictional provisions to the misdemeanors described above.
Existing law details procedures for a governmental entity to gather specified records from a provider of electronic communication service or a remote computing service by search warrant. Existing law specifies that no notice is required to be given to a subscriber or customer by a governmental entity receiving records pursuant to these procedures.
This bill would additionally authorize a governmental entity to use those procedures to gather the contents of communications between the subscriber and the service provider. The bill would require a search warrant used under those procedures to be limited to only that information necessary to achieve the objective of the warrant, as specified. The bill would require information obtained through the execution of a search warrant pursuant that is unrelated to the objective of the warrant to be sealed and not be subject to further review without an order from the court. The bill would require the governmental entity to provide a specified notice to the customer or subscriber upon receipt of the requested records. The bill would authorize a delay of that notice in 90-day increments if there is reason to believe notification would may have an adverse effect, as defined.","Provides that the jurisdiction of a criminal action for unauthorized use, retention, or transfer of personal identifying information shall also include the county where the theft of the personal identifying information occurred, the county in which the victim resided at the time the offense was committed, or the county where the information was used for an illegal purpose. Provides that multiple offenses of unauthorized use of personal identifying information, either all involving the same defendant or defendants and the same personal identifying information belonging to the one person, or all involving the same scheme or substantially similar activity, occur in multiple jurisdictions. Provides that jurisdiction also extends to all associated offenses connected together in their commission to the underlying identity theft offense or identity theft offenses."
"Existing law generally requires that an employee of a temporary services employer, as defined, be paid weekly. Existing law provides that a violation of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor.
This bill would, with certain exceptions, make the weekly pay requirement applicable to a security guard employed by a private patrol operator who is a temporary services employer, as provided.
By expanding the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

The act provides the employer with the right to cure certain violations before the employee may bring a civil action, as specified. For other violations, the act requires the employee to follow specified procedures before bringing an action.
This bill would provide the employer with the right to cure any violation of the Labor Code covered by the act before the employee may bring a civil action.

"Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. Under existing law, certain aged, blind, and disabled Medi-Cal recipients are required to pay a share of cost as a condition of eligibility, with the share of cost determined in accordance with specified requirements. For purposes of determining the share of cost, existing law establishes a formula to calculate the personal and incidental needs deduction for an individual residing in a licensed community care facility. Existing law prohibits that deduction from exceeding the amount by which the Supplemental Security Income recipient retention amount, as defined, exceeds $20.
This bill would revise the formula to determine the personal and incidental needs deduction. By increasing the responsibility of the counties in determining Medi-Cal eligibility, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require that its provisions be implemented only to the extent that federal financial participation is available and that the department receives any necessary federal approvals.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

This bill would establish, for contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2016, a claim resolution process applicable to all claims by contractors in connection with public works. The bill would define a claim as a separate demand by the contractor for one or more of the following: a time extension for relief from damages or penalties for delay, payment of money or damages arising from work done pursuant to the contract for a public work, or payment of an amount disputed by the public entity, as specified.
The bill would require a public entity, defined to exclude certain state entities, upon receipt of a claim sent by registered or certified mail, to review it and, within 45 days, provide a written statement identifying the disputed and undisputed portions of the claim. The 45-day period may be extended by mutual agreement. The bill would require any payment due on an undisputed portion of the claim to be processed within 60 days, as specified. The bill, if the public entity fails to issue the written statement, would require that the claim be deemed rejected in its entirety.

The bill applies this requirement to all claims by contractors in connection with public works for one or more of the following: a time extension, including, without limitation, for relief from damages or penalties for delay assessed by a public entity under a public works contract; payment by the public entity of money or damages arising from work done by, or on behalf of, the contractor pursuant to the contract for a public work and payment for which is not otherwise expressly provided or to which the claimant is not otherwise entitled; and payment of an amount that is disputed by the public entity."
"Existing law allows individuals charged with specified crimes to qualify for deferred entry of judgment. A defendant qualifies if he or she has no conviction for any offense involving controlled substances, the charged offense did not involve violence, there is no evidence of a violation relating to narcotics or restricted dangerous drugs other than a violation that qualifies for the program, the defendant’s record does not indicate that probation or parole has ever been revoked without being completed, and the defendant’s record does not indicate that he or she has been granted diversion, deferred entry of judgment, or was convicted of a felony within 5 years prior to the alleged commission of the charged offense.
Under the existing deferred entry of judgment program, an eligible defendant may have entry of judgment deferred, upon pleading guilty to the offenses charged and entering a drug treatment program for 18 months to 3 years. If the defendant does not perform satisfactorily in the program, does not benefit from the program, is convicted of specified crimes, or engages in criminal activity rendering him or her unsuitable for deferred entry of judgment, the defendant’s guilty plea is entered and the court enters judgment and proceeds to schedule a sentencing hearing. If the defendant completes the program, the criminal charges are dismissed. Existing law allows the presiding judge of the superior court, with the district attorney and public defender, to establish a pretrial diversion drug program.
This bill would make the deferred entry of judgment program a pretrial diversion program. The bill would provide that a defendant qualifies for the pretrial diversion program if he or she has no prior conviction within 5 years prior to the alleged commission of the charged offense for any offense involving controlled substances other than the offense that qualifies him or her for diversion, the charged offense did not involve violence, there is no evidence of a violation relating to narcotics or restricted dangerous drugs other than a violation that qualifies for the program and the defendant has no prior conviction for a serious or violent felony within 5 years prior to the alleged commission of the charged offense.
Under the pretrial diversion program created by this bill, a qualifying defendant would enter a not guilty plea, and proceedings would be suspended in order for the defendant to enter a drug treatment program for 6 months to one year, or longer if requested by the defendant with good cause. The bill would require the court, if the defendant does not perform satisfactorily in the program or is convicted of specified crimes, to terminate the program and reinstate the criminal proceedings. The bill would require the criminal charges to be dismissed if the defendant completes the program.","Amends the California criminal code to allow a defendant to participate in a pretrial diversion program if the defendant has no prior conviction within five years prior to the alleged commission of the offense and: (1) the offense does not involve a crime of violence or threatened violence; (2) there is no evidence of a violation relating to narcotics or restricted dangerous drugs; (3) the defendant has no prior conviction within five years prior to the alleged commission of a serious felony; and (4) the defendant has no prior conviction within five years prior to the alleged commission of such an offense. Directs the prosecuting attorney to file with the court a declaration for the record grounds upon which the determination is based, and to make this information available to the defendant and his or her attorney. Requires: (1) all referrals for pretrial diversion to be made only to programs certified by the county drug program administrator; and (2) the defendant to request to be referred to a program in any county. Authorizes a defendant who is participating in a program to be required to undergo analysis of his or her urine for the purpose of testing for the presence of any drug as part of the program, but prohibits the urinalysis results from being admissible as a basis for any new criminal prosecution or proceeding."
"Existing law subjects an employer who is, or wishes to become, a contractor with the state for public works, or for goods or services, to various nondiscrimination requirements. Existing law authorizes requiring an employer to submit a nondiscrimination program to the Department of Fair Employment and Housing for approval and certification, prior to becoming a contractor or subcontractor with the state, as well as requiring the provision of periodic reports of contractor or subcontractor compliance with that program.
This bill would enact the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act of 2015. The bill would require an employer with 100 or more employees in state, as specified, and a contract of 30 days or more, prior to becoming a contractor or subcontractor with the state, to submit a nondiscrimination program to the Department of Fair Employment and Housing and to submit periodic reports no more than annually of its compliance with that program. The bill would authorize the department to require approval and certification of the program. The bill would permit the department to require an employer with fewer than 100 employees in state or a contract of less than 30 days to submit a nondiscrimination report. The bill would require the department to define an employee for these purposes. The bill would require the nondiscrimination program to include policies and procedures designed to ensure equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees, an analysis of employment selection procedures, and a workforce analysis, as specified. The bill would specify that its provisions are not to be construed to negate certain exemptions established by regulation that predate its enactment or to require the department to reevaluate the validity of these exemptions, as specified. The bill would make a statement of legislative findings.",". The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.) Equal Pay for Equal Work Act of 2015 (Sec. 3) This bill requires employers with 100 or more employees in California, prior to becoming a contractor or subcontractor on a public work contract or with a contract of 30 days or more, to submit a nondiscrimination program to the state and submit periodic reports. Employers with 100 or more employees covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement must submit to the state a nondiscrimination program analysis. The total wages required to be reported on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 for all overtime worked, and regular hourly pay of not less than 30% of the state minimum wage rate, shall be excluded from calculation of the employer's total number of employees. Exempt employees shall be presumed to work 40 hours a week for purposes of this reporting requirement. Every state contract and subcontract for public works or services shall contain a nondiscrimination clause prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, and sex."
"Existing law, the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program, establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions.
Under the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Program, a student who transfers from a California community college to a qualifying institution that offers a baccalaureate degree and who was not awarded a Cal Grant A or B Entitlement award, receives a Cal Grant A or B award if, at the time of the transfer, the student meets specified requirements, among which is a requirement that the student not be 28 years of age or older by December 31 of the award year.
This bill would provide that the requirement that a student not be 28 years or older by December 31 of the award year, as described above, would not apply to a current or former member of the Armed Forces of the United States, as defined, who was seeking a Cal Grant A or B award under this provision, unless he or she is a former member who received a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge. The bill would prohibit a qualifying institution from accepting award funds under the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Program and Title 38 of the United States Code in the same award year for a current or former member of the Armed Forces of the United States who is 28 years of age or older.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on June 22, 2011. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Entitles any California resident transferring from a California community college to a qualifying institution offering a baccalaureate degree to a Cal Grant A or B award, based on specified criteria, if that student: (1) was not awarded a Cal Grant A or B award at the time of his or her high school graduation, but, at the time of transfer from a California community college to a qualifying baccalaureate program, meets all of the criteria set forth in this Act; (2) has earned a community college grade point average of at least 2.4 on a 4.0 scale and is eligible to transfer to a qualifying institution that offers a baccalaureate degree; (3) has earned a community college grade point average of at least 2.4 on a 4.0 scale and is eligible to transfer to a qualifying institution that offers a baccalaureate degree; (4) has an income and asset level not exceeding the limits set forth in this Act; (5) is pursuing a baccalaureate degree that is offered by a qualifying institution; (6) meets the general Cal Grant eligibility requirements; and (7) will not be 28 years of age or older by December 31 of the award year.

"The Personal Income Tax Law allows various deductions in computing income that is subject to tax under that law.
This bill, for taxable years on or after January 1, 2016, and before January 1, 2021, would allow a deduction from

"The Outdoor Advertising Act provides for the regulation by the Department of Transportation of advertising displays, as defined, within view of public highways. The act exempts from certain of its provisions advertising displays that advertise the business conducted or services rendered or goods produced or sold on the property upon which the display is placed, as specified.
This bill would exempt from those provisions of the act advertising displays located in specific geographic areas in the City of Los Angeles if those displays meet specified conditions and requirements, including the adoption of, and compliance with, an ordinance by the City of Los Angeles. The bill would impose certain conditions if an advertising display authorized by this bill is a message center display. The bill would require the department, before the advertising display may be placed, to determine or to request the Federal Highway Administration to determine that the display will not cause a reduction in federal aid funds or otherwise be inconsistent with any federal law, regulation, or agreement between the state and a federal agency or department.
The bill would make the City of Los Angeles primarily responsible for ensuring that a display remains in compliance with the ordinance and the bill’s requirements, and would require the city to indemnify and hold the department harmless if the city fails to do so.
This bill would also make findings and declarations as to the need for a special statute relating to the City of Los Angeles.","Provides, if the city of Los Angeles has adopted an advertising display ordinance and the owner of such display has certified that it meets minimum requirements, that the display may not advertise products, goods, or services related to tobacco, firearms, or explicit material.

"The Psychology Licensing Law provides for the licensure and regulation of psychologists by the Board of Psychology. The law defines the practice of psychology as rendering or offering to render, for a fee, psychological services involving the application of psychological principles and methods, including the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of psychological problems and emotional and mental disorders. The law prohibits unlicensed persons from practicing psychology, but authorizes unlicensed persons, including psychological assistants who meet certain requirements and do not provide psychological services to the public for a fee, to perform limited psychological functions. The law requires applicants for licensure to, among other things, engage in at least 2 years of supervised professional experience under the direction of a licensed psychologist and authorizes an applicant who obtains this experience in the United States to send verification of the experience directly to the board if the supervising licensed psychologist fails to submit the verification within 30 days of receiving a request from the applicant, as specified. The law requires the board to establish qualifications by regulation for supervising licensed psychologists and to review and approve applicants for the position of supervising psychologist on a case-by-case basis. The law provides that a violation of any of its provisions is a misdemeanor.
This bill would remove the reference to fees for services from the definition of the practice of psychology, thereby expanding that definition. The bill would further modify that definition to specify that the application of psychological principles and methods includes assessment, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and intervention to increase effective functioning of individuals, groups, and organizations. The bill would revise the above-described authorization for psychological assistants to prohibit services to the public, except as specified, without reference to a fee. The bill would revise that experience verification procedure to require a supervising licensed psychologist to submit verification of the experience to the trainee in a manner prescribed by the board, and would authorize the board to establish alternative procedures for obtaining the necessary documentation if the supervising licensed psychologist fails to provide that verification in a timely manner. The bill would make the failure to provide verification to the board upon request, absent good cause, unprofessional conduct. The bill would eliminate the requirement that the board review and approve applicants for the position of supervising psychologist on a case-by-case basis. The bill would also make technical and conforming changes. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law establishes for a patient of a psychotherapist, whether or not a party to a proceeding, the privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent another from disclosing a confidential communication between the patient and psychotherapist, as specified, and defines a psychotherapist for these purposes.

"Existing law provides that a judgment that a criminal defendant pay a fine, other than a restitution fine or order, may also direct that he or she be imprisoned until the fine is satisfied. Existing law requires the judgment to specify the term of imprisonment for nonpayment of the fine, and prohibits that term from exceeding one day for each $30 of the fine, or exceeding the term for which the defendant may be sentenced for the offense of which he or she has been convicted.
Existing law also provides that in all felony and misdemeanor convictions, either by plea or by verdict, when the defendant has been in custody, all days of custody of the defendant, as specified, are to be credited upon his or her term of imprisonment, or credited to any fine, on a proportional basis, that may be imposed, at the rate of not less than $30 per day, in the discretion of the court imposing the sentence.

"(1) The Nonprofit Corporation Law authorizes a presiding officer of a religious denomination, society, or church to form a corporation sole for the purpose of administering and managing its affairs. The law requires the Secretary of State to file articles of incorporation of a corporation sole, if the articles of incorporation conform to law.
This bill would require the Secretary of State, if he or she determines the articles of incorporation to form a corporation sole did not conform to law, to nonetheless file it if the articles of incorporation are resubmitted with an accompanying written opinion of a member of the State Bar of California that the specific provision of the articles of incorporation objected to by the Secretary of State conform to law and state the points and authorities upon which the written opinion is based.
(2) Subject to conformance with law and filing with the Secretary of State, the Nonprofit Corporation Law authorizes a chief officer of a corporation sole to amend the articles of incorporation if the amendment includes a signed and verified statement setting forth the provisions of the amendment and stating that the amendment has been duly authorized by the religious organization governed by the corporation sole. The law also requires a declaration of dissolution of a corporation sole to include, among other things, a statement that the dissolution of the corporation sole has been duly authorized by the religious organization governed by the corporation sole.
This bill would expand those provisions to also allow those statements to be duly authorized by the hierarchical religious organization or entity responsible for forming the corporation sole, or by the hierarchical religious organization or entity responsible for overseeing the corporation sole according to the rules, canons, regulations, or discipline of the religious denomination, society, or church as to which the corporation sole is affiliated.

This bill would additionally authorize those assets to be transferred to the trustees on behalf of the corporation sole, the hierarchical religious organization or entity responsible for forming the corporation sole, or the hierarchical religious organization or entity responsible for overseeing the corporation sole according to the rules, canons, regulations, or discipline of the religious denomination, society, or church to which the corporation sole is affiliated.

The California Fair Employment and Housing Act provides that nothing in that act relating to discrimination on account of sex affects the right of an employer to use veteran status as a factor in employee selection or to give special consideration to Vietnam-era veterans.
This bill would enact the Voluntary Veterans’ Preference Employment Policy Act to authorize a private employer to establish and maintain a written veterans’ preference employment policy, to be applied uniformly to hiring decisions, to give a voluntary preference for hiring or retaining a veteran over another qualified applicant or employee. The bill would provide that the granting of a veterans’ preference pursuant to the bill, in and of itself, shall be deemed not to violate any local or state equal employment opportunity law or regulation, including, but not limited to, the antidiscrimination provisions of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. The bill would revise the existing veteran status provision in the California Fair Employment and Housing Act to remove references to discrimination on account of sex and to Vietnam-era veterans, and would, instead, provide that nothing in that act relating to discrimination affects the right of an employer to use veteran status as a factor in hiring decisions if the employer maintains a veterans’ preference employment policy established in accordance with the Voluntary Veterans’ Preference Employment Policy Act.

"The Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law, the violation of which is a crime, imposes a tax of $0.87 per package of 20 cigarettes on every distributor of cigarettes and a tax on the wholesale cost of tobacco products distributed at a tax rate that is equivalent to the combined rate of all taxes imposed on cigarettes, and at a rate equivalent to $0.50 per pack cigarette tax. Revenues from taxes imposed under this law are deposited in specified accounts. These taxes are inclusive of the taxes imposed under the Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act of 1988 (Proposition 99) and the California Children and Families Act of 1998 (Proposition 10).
This bill would require moneys collected and deposited in the California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 Fund from an additional tax to be imposed on the distribution of cigarettes, a related floor stock tax, and a cigarette indicia adjustment tax to be transferred from that fund to the California Children and Families Trust Fund, which is a continuously appropriated fund, thereby making an appropriation, the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Surtax Fund, the Breast Cancer Fund, and the General Fund, as necessary to offset revenue decreases to those funds directly resulting from additional taxes to be imposed.
This bill would also make funds of accounts in the California Tobacco Tax Act of 2015 Fund available to specified state entities upon appropriation by the Legislature to supplement tobacco prevention and control programs, to improve existing programs to provide quality and access to health care programs for families and children, and to supplement funding for the enforcement of laws that regulate the distribution and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products, as specified.

"Existing law prohibits the management of hazardous waste, except in accordance with the hazardous waste laws. Existing law requires the Department of Toxic Substances Control to regulate the management and disposal of hazardous waste. Under existing regulations, the department classifies a waste as hazardous waste if the waste exceeds certain total threshold limitation concentrations, which are established by the department for various substances, including barium. A violation of the hazardous waste laws is a crime.
This bill, except as specified, would provide that used, broken cathode ray tube (CRT) panel glass and processed CRT panel glass that exceeds the total threshold limit concentration only for barium is not a waste and is not subject to regulation by the department if that panel glass meets certain requirements. The bill would provide that used, broken CRT panel glass and processed CRT panel glass that is recycled is not subject to the department’s regulations on the export of materials. The bill would prohibit the use of that CRT panel glass except in specified end uses. Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

The bill would require the local public health officer or his or her designee to direct the responsible party to notify residents affected by the leak if he or she determines that the leak poses a serious threat to public health and safety. Because the bill would require a local health officer or his or her designee to provide a higher level of service to the public, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would require an owner or operator of an active gas pipeline in a sensitive area, upon discovery of a leak from the pipeline, to notify the division and the appropriate local health officer or his or her designee of the leak. Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

By creating additional duties for local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize the department to implement and administer these provisions through all-county letters or similar instructions until regulations are adopted, and would require the department to, no later than July 1, 2016, adopt emergency regulations.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code, with respect to the California in-home supportive services program, to allow an applicant for or recipient of program services to designate an authorized representative who is designated in writing by the Department of Health and Human Services to accompany, assist, and represent the applicant or recipient for purposes related to the program, including the application process, direction of services, and redetermination of eligibility. An authorized representative shall not authorize representation for an administrative hearing conducted by the department. The bill allows: (1) an applicant or recipient who has a legal representative with the legal authority to act on behalf of the applicant or recipient that includes decisionmaking authority for purposes reasonably believed to be related to the program to not complete an authorized representative form, and (2) a legal representative to designate an authorized representative for an applicant or recipient who is a minor. The following individuals shall not serve as authorized representatives: an individual who is prevented from being a provider of services pursuant to specified provisions, and an individual who is prevented from being a provider of services pursuant to this bill."
"Existing law, except as specified, prohibits any state agency from expending funds appropriated for design-build projects until the Department of Finance and the State Public Works Board have approved performance criteria for the project.
This bill would include among the exceptions to those provisions amounts appropriated for projects at the Salton Sea.
Existing law requires either the Director of General Services or the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to notify the State Public Works Board regarding the method to be used for selecting a design-build entity, prior to advertising the design-build project.
This bill would, for purposes of projects at the Salton Sea, instead require the Director of the Department of Water Resources to notify the California Water Commission regarding the method to be used for selecting a design-build entry, prior to advertising a design-build project.
The bill would make other conforming changes.
Existing law authorizes any public corporation, as defined, and specified private corporations to apply for the privilege of establishing, operating, and maintaining a foreign-trade zone in accordance with federal law, and provides that any public or private corporation whose application is granted pursuant to federal law is authorized to establish, operate, and maintain a foreign-trade zone, subject to specified conditions. Existing law also authorizes a public corporation, if authorized to establish, operate, and maintain a foreign trade zone, to provide the United States with indemnity or assurance and to deposit sums of money with the United States as requested.
This bill would combine and reorganize these provisions and would repeal that indemnity and assurance provision.","This bill amends the Government Code to prohibit the expenditure of funds appropriated for a design-build project by any state agency, including, but not limited to, the University of California, the California State University, the California Community Colleges, and the Judicial Council, until the Department of Finance and the State Public Works Board have approved criteria. The bill defines ""design-build project"" as a capital outlay project using the design-build construction procurement process in which both the design and construction of a project are procured from a single entity. Amounts appropriated for a design-build project shall not be expended by any state agency, including, but not limited to, the University of California, the California State University, the California Community Colleges, and the Judicial Council, until the Department of Finance and the State Public Works Board have approved criteria."
"(1)Existing law, the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act, requires each glass container manufacturer in the state to use a minimum percentage of 35% of postfilled glass, except as specified, in the manufacturing of glass food, drink, or beverage containers.

"(1) Existing law, the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program, establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C awards, and the Cal Grant T awards under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions.
Under the California Community College Transfer Cal Grant Entitlement Program, a student who transfers from a California community college to a qualifying institution that offers a baccalaureate degree receives a Cal Grant A or B award if the student meets specified requirements, among which is that the student graduate from a California high school or its equivalent during or after the 2000–01 academic year.
This bill would, commencing with the 2017–18 academic year, exempt a student from the requirement that the student graduate from a California high school or its equivalent if he or she did not graduate from high school or its equivalent and was a California resident, as determined pursuant to specified provisions of law, on his or her 18th birthday.
(2) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 69436 of the Education Code proposed by SB 1314 that would become operative if this bill and SB 1314 are both enacted and this bill is chaptered last.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on May 17, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Education Code to revise the California Community College Grant program. Specifically, the bill entitles a student who was not awarded a Cal Grant A or B award pursuant to the program at the time of his or her high school graduation but, at the time of transfer from a California community college to a qualifying baccalaureate program, to be entitled to a Cal Grant A or B award. The California Community College Commission shall award a Cal Grant A or B award to any California resident transferring from a California community college to a qualifying institution that offers a baccalaureate degree if the student: has applied for and received a complete official financial aid application no later than the March 2 of the year immediately preceding the award year; has earned a community college grade point average of at least 2.4 on a 4.0 scale and is eligible to transfer to a qualifying institution that offers a baccalaureate degree; the student's household has an income and asset level not exceeding specified limits; the student will not be 28 years of age or older by December 31 of the award year; and the student graduated from a California high school or its equivalent during or after the 200001 academic year.

"Existing law, the federal National Voter Registration Act of 1993, requires a state to, among other things, establish procedures to register a person to vote by application made simultaneously with an application for a new or renewal of a motor vehicle driver’s license. The federal act requires the motor vehicle driver’s license application to serve as an application for voter registration with respect to an election for federal office, unless the applicant fails to sign the application, and requires the application to be considered as updating the applicant’s previous voter registration, if any. The federal act defines “motor vehicle driver’s license” to include any personal identification document issued by a state motor vehicle authority.
Under existing state law, a person may not be registered to vote except by affidavit of registration. Existing law requires a properly executed affidavit of registration to be deemed effective upon receipt of the affidavit by the county elections official if the affidavit is submitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles on or before the 15th day before the election. Existing state law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Secretary of State to develop a process and the infrastructure to allow a person who is qualified to register to vote in the state to register to vote online.
Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver’s licenses and state identification cards to applicants who meet specified criteria and provide the department with the required information. Existing law generally requires an applicant for an original driver’s license or state identification card to submit satisfactory proof to the department that the applicant’s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law.
This bill would require the Secretary of State and the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish the California New Motor Voter Program for the purpose of increasing opportunities for voter registration by any person who is qualified to be a voter. Under the program, after the Secretary of State certifies that certain enumerated conditions are satisfied, the Department of Motor Vehicles would be required to electronically provide to the Secretary of State the records of each person who is issued an original or renewal of a driver’s license or state identification card or who provides the department with a change of address, as specified. The person’s motor vehicle records would then constitute a completed affidavit of registration and the person would be registered to vote, unless the person affirmatively declined to be registered to vote during a transaction with the department, the department did not represent to the Secretary of State that the person attested that he or she meets all voter eligibility requirements, as specified, or the Secretary of State determines that the person is ineligible to vote. The bill would require the Secretary of State to adopt regulations to implement this program, as specified.
Under existing law, the willful, unauthorized disclosure of information from a Department of Motor Vehicles record to any person, or the use of any false representation to obtain information from a department record or any use of information obtained from any department record for a purpose other than the one stated in the request or the sale or other distribution of the information to a person or organization for purposes not disclosed in the request is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year, or both fine and imprisonment.
This bill would provide that disclosure of information contained in the records obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to the California New Motor Voter Program is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year, or both fine and imprisonment. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law, the Information Practices Act of 1977, authorizes every state agency to maintain in its records only personal information that is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency, or is required or authorized by state or federal law. That act specifies the situations in which disclosure is permissible and also specifies the manner in which agencies must account for disclosures of personal information, including those due to security breaches, among other provisions.
This bill would require the Secretary of State to establish procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of information acquired from the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to the California New Motor Voter Program and would state that the provisions of the Information Practices Act of 1977 govern disclosures pursuant to the program.
Existing law makes it a crime for a person to willfully cause, procure, or allow himself or herself or any other person to be registered as a voter, knowing that he or she or that other person is not entitled to registration. Existing law also makes it a crime to fraudulently vote or attempt to vote.
This bill would provide that if a person who is ineligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of the California New Motor Voter Program in the absence of a violation by that person of the crime described above, that person’s registration shall be presumed to have been effected with official authorization and not the fault of that person. The bill would also provide that if a person who is ineligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of this program, and that person votes or attempts to vote in an election held after the effective date of the person’s registration, that person shall be presumed to have acted with official authorization and is not guilty of fraudulently voting or attempting to vote, unless that person willfully votes or attempts to vote knowing that he or she is not entitled to vote.
This bill would also make conforming changes.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 2102 of the Elections Code, proposed by SB 589, that would become operative only if SB 589 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on September 19, 2014.

This bill would establish the California Covenants Program, under the administration of the Treasurer. The program would be a prepaid college tuition program, under which an individual could purchase a fixed percentage of the tuition and mandatory systemwide fees for an academic year of full-time enrollment as an undergraduate at a campus of the California State University, the University of California, or an independent institution of higher education, as specified, for a beneficiary who meets specified criteria.
The bill would establish the California Covenants Program Fund. The bill would require that the moneys received by the Treasurer from the individuals who purchase tuition certificates under the program, as well as the proceeds from the sale of certain bonds authorized by the bill, be deposited in the fund. The bill would authorize the Treasurer, upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act, to allocate moneys deposited in the fund to the California State University, the University of California, or an independent institution of higher education to pay the tuition and mandatory systemwide fees of beneficiaries of the program during that fiscal year. The bill would require the Director of Finance to determine, at the commencement of each fiscal year, whether there are sufficient funds to implement the program in that fiscal year, and to communicate this determination to the Treasurer in a timely manner each fiscal year.

The certificate shall cover annual tuition and fee increases of 7.5 percent or less. Treasury shall have the discretion to periodically adjust the cost of the tuition certificates in light of changes in the cost of living, the economy of the state, and the levels of tuition and mandatory systemwide fees charged by the participating segments. The purchaser of a tuition certificate shall specify its intended beneficiary, which shall be any person who has not yet commenced grade 11 or its equivalent.

"Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver’s licenses to applicants who meet specified criteria and provide the department with the required information. Existing law generally requires an applicant for an original driver’s license or identification card to submit satisfactory proof to the department that the applicant’s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law.
This bill would also require, beginning July 1, 2016, an applicant for an original driver’s license or identification card to submit satisfactory proof of California residency, and would prohibit the department from issuing an original driver’s license or identification card to a person who does not submit satisfactory proof of California residency. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations relating to the procedures for verifying that the applicant is a California resident.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 19, 2013.

"Existing law provides that individuals with disabilities or medical conditions have the same right as the general public to the full and free use of the streets, highways, sidewalks, walkways, public buildings, medical facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and physicians’ offices, public facilities, and other public places. Existing law prescribes a process for prosecuting an action in this regard and provides that a person aggrieved or potentially aggrieved by a violation of these rights may bring an action for damages and that a prevailing party is entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees.
This bill would except from the application of these provisions public buildings, public facilities, and other public places of a public entity that, on specified dates, met specified disability access design standards. The bill would provide that a public entity’s possession of a close out letter from the State Architect certifying that the buildings, facilities, and other places to which the letter applies meet the applicable building and construction-related accessibility standards of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act serves as presumptive evidence that the public buildings, facilities, and places are in compliance with this part and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.
Existing law prescribes a process in certain construction-related accessibility claims against a place of public accommodation. This process permits statutory damages to be awarded against a place of public accommodation only if the violation denied the plaintiff full and equal access to the place of public accommodation on a particular occasion. This process also reduces a defendant’s minimum statutory damage liability to $1,000 if the defendant demonstrates that it has corrected all construction-related violations that are the basis of a claim within 60 days of being served with the complaint, and other select conditions are met.
This bill would apply the process described above to an action commenced on or after that January 1, 2016, or an action commenced prior to that date for which a final judgment has not been entered, to public buildings, public facilities, and other public places of

Existing law, with certain exceptions, establishes 8 hours as a day’s work and a 40-hour workweek, and requires payment of prescribed overtime compensation for additional hours worked. Existing law establishes the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement in the Department of Industrial Relations for the enforcement of labor laws, including overtime payment. Under existing law, a person who violates the provisions regulating work hours is guilty of a misdemeanor.

Notwithstanding that provision, the bill would require the State Board of Education to waive the prohibition upon the request of the governing board of a school district if the governing board of the school district meets certain conditions, including, among others, demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the state board, that the certificated employee subject to transfer or assignment has the appropriate credential necessary to teach a specific course, grade level, or program of study, and there is a critical shortage for certificated employees with such a credential in the local labor market.
The bill also would prohibit a pupil from being knowingly assigned to a classroom where the teacher of record received an unsatisfactory performance rating in the most recent evaluation and assessment of the employee’s job performance unless the employee is actively participating in a California Peer Assistance and Review Program or other specified conditions are met. The bill would authorize the governing board of a school district to waive the prohibition on an individual basis, as provided.
To the extent this bill would impose additional duties on school districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(Sec. 1) Declares that it is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this Act to ensure that military families have access to the child care development services that their children need.

Existing law requires the governing board of each school district to establish standards of expected pupil achievement at each grade level in each area of study and to evaluate and assess certificated employee performance on a continuing basis as it reasonably relates to specified matters, including pupil progress, as provided. Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district to develop and adopt additional evaluation and assessment guidelines or criteria.
This bill would

"The Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 authorizes an aggrieved employee to bring a civil action to recover specified civil penalties, that would otherwise be assessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, on behalf of the employee and other current or former employees for the violation of certain provisions affecting employees. The act provides the employer with the right to cure certain violations before the employee may bring a civil action, as specified. For other violations, the act requires the employee to follow specified procedures before bringing an action.
Existing law requires an employer to provide its employees with specified information regarding their wages, including, among others, the inclusive dates of the period for which the employee is paid and the name and address of the legal entity that is the employer, either semimonthly or at the time of each wage payment and provides that the employer does not have the right to cure a violation of that requirement before an employee may bring a civil action under the act.
This bill would provide an employer with the right to cure a violation of the requirement that an employer provide its employees with the inclusive dates of the pay period and the name and address of the legal entity that is the employer before an employee may bring a civil action under the act. The bill would provide that a violation of that requirement shall only be considered cured upon a showing that the employer has provided a fully compliant, itemized wage statement to each aggrieved employee, as specified. The bill would limit the employer’s right to cure with respect to alleged violations of these provisions to once in a 12-month period, as specified. The bill would also delete references to obsolete provisions of law.

"The federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 provides for workforce investment activities, including activities in which states may participate. Existing law contains various programs for job training and employment investment, including work incentive programs, as specified, and establishes local workforce investment boards to perform duties related to the implementation and coordination of local workforce investment activities. Existing law requires local workforce investment boards to spend a minimum percentage of specified funds for adults and dislocated workers on federally identified workforce training programs and allows the boards to leverage specified funds to meet the funding requirements, as specified. Existing law authorizes a credit of up to 10% of that funding minimum for leveraged funds, which include Pell Grants and employment training panel grants.
This bill would expand the types of services to which leveraged funds may be applied to include supportive services and would expand the types of leveraged funds that may be applied to the 10% credit, described above, to include specified federal, local, state, and private funds.

"(1) Existing law prohibits an employer from discharging an employee or in any manner discriminating, retaliating, or taking any adverse action against any employee or applicant for employment because the employee or applicant has engaged in protected conduct, as specified. Existing law provides that an employee who made a bona fide complaint, and was consequently discharged or otherwise suffered an adverse action, is entitled to reinstatement and reimbursement for lost wages. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for an employer to willfully refuse to reinstate or otherwise restore an employee who is determined by a specified procedure to be eligible for reinstatement. Existing law subjects a person who violates these provisions to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation.
This bill would extend the protections of these provisions, as specified, to an employee who is a family member of a person who engaged in, or was perceived to engage in, the protected conduct or make a complaint protected by these provisions. This bill would define terms for the purpose of these provisions.
(2) Existing law requires a client employer to share with a labor contractor all civil legal responsibility and civil liability for all workers supplied by that labor contractor for the payment of wages and the failure to obtain valid workers’ compensation coverage. Existing law also prohibits a client employer from shifting to the labor contractor legal duties or liabilities under workplace safety provisions with respect to workers provided by the labor contractor. Existing law defines terms for these purposes and authorizes the Labor Commissioner to adopt regulations and rules of practice and procedure necessary to administer and enforce these provisions. Existing law excludes certain types of employers from these provisions, including, but not limited to, a client employer that is not a motor carrier of property based solely on the employer’s use of a third-party motor carrier of property with interstate or intrastate operating authority to ship or receive freight, and a client employer that is a motor carrier of property subcontracting with, or otherwise engaging, another motor carrier of property to provide transportation services using its own employees and commercial motor vehicles.
The Household Goods Carriers Act subjects household goods carriers to the jurisdiction and control of the Public Utilities Commission. The act prohibits a household goods carrier from engaging, or attempting to engage, in the business of the transportation of used household goods and personal effects by motor vehicle over any public highway in the state without a permit issued by the commission authorizing transportation entirely within the state, or a valid operating authority issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration for interstate transportation.
This bill would expand the types of employers excluded from those labor contracting provisions to include a client employer that is not a household goods carrier based solely on the employer’s use of a third-party household goods carrier permitted by the commission to move household goods, and a client employer that is a permitted household goods carrier subcontracting with, or otherwise engaging, another permitted household goods carrier to provide transportation of household goods using its own employees and motor vehicles.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on November 6, 2001.

"Existing law requires an insurance policy to specify certain information, including, but not limited to, the parties to the contract, the property or life insured, the risks insured against, premium, and the coverage period. Existing law, commencing January 1, 2016, and with regard to private passenger automobile insurance that provides coverage for 6 months or longer, specified residential property insurance, and policies of individual disability income insurance that are issued and take effect or that are renewed on or after January 1, 2016, requires an insurer to maintain a verifiable process or adopt a procedure that allows an applicant or policyholder to designate one additional person to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation of a policy for nonpayment of premium, as specified. Existing law provides that if an insurer opts to adopt the verifiable process, then the insurer, shall provide the policyholder, within 30 days after the inception of an individual policy, with notice of the right to designate one person. Existing law provides that if a policyholder pays the premium for an insurance policy through a payroll or pension deduction plan, then the notice of the right to designate one person need only be sent within 60 days after the policyholder is no longer on that deduction payment plan. Existing law further requires the application form for an insurance policy to clearly indicate the deduction payment plan selected by the applicant.
This bill would delete the requirement that the application form clearly indicate the deduction payment plan selected by the applicant. The bill would make these provisions inapplicable to a policy of disability income insurance if the premiums for the policy are paid entirely by the employer.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Insurance Code of California to require insurers to: (1) maintain a verifiable process that allows a policyholder to designate, in writing or by electronic transmission, one additional person to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation of a policy for nonpayment of premium; and (2) notify the policyholder, within 30 days after the inception date of such policy, with notice of the right to designate one person, in addition to the policyholder, to receive such notice. Directs the insurer to instruct the policyholder on how to request and delete such a designation. Requires: (1) insurers to retain and utilize the contact information provided in the written designation for the lifetime of the policy, and allow the policyholder to update the written designation if the policyholder so requests; and (2) a policyholder to retain such right."
"Existing law provides unemployment compensation benefits to eligible persons who are unemployed through no fault of their own. Existing law, the California Training Benefits Program, until January 1, 2019, authorizes an unemployed individual, who is otherwise eligible for unemployment benefits, to apply to the Employment Development Department for a determination of potential eligibility for benefits during a period of training or retraining.
Existing law sets forth the eligibility criteria for the program, including that the individual is a journey level union member and the training or retraining course of instruction is industry-related training necessary due to changes in technology, or industry demands, or is necessary to retain employment or to become more competitive in obtaining employment.
This bill would recast these provisions to permit eligibility for a member of a union or trade association, a participant in training sponsored by an employer, or an individual who is a participant in a state or federally approved apprenticeship program.
Existing law sets the maximum benefit amount under the program at 52 times the weekly benefit amount, including the maximum award under the parent compensation claim, as defined, and requires that benefits received under any federal unemployment compensation law be included as benefits payable under these provisions.
This bill recast those provisions to set forth certain federally funded unemployment benefits to be included within these benefits. Because the bill would make changes to existing eligibility requirements for training and benefits, which would result in additional amounts being payable from the Unemployment Fund for those benefits, the bill would make an appropriation.
This bill would make changes to delete references to the repealed federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and instead refer to the successor federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.
Existing law requires the Director of Employment Development to report to the Legislature by June 30 of each year on the Employment Development Department’s fraud deterrence and detection activities.
This bill would instead require the report to be made to specified committees of the Legislature.
Existing law requires the director to prepare and report to specified committees of the Legislature and the State Office of Information Technology on the department’s automation plans, including recommendations on improvements and long-term goals and strategies. Existing law requires the report to provide a strategic information plan.
This bill would revise what committees are to receive the report, as specified, and replace references to the State Office of Information Technology with the California Department of Technology.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 13, 2012.

Existing law requires an attorney or law firm establishing an IOLTA account to report IOLTA account compliance and all other IOLTA account information required by the State Bar in the manner specified by the State Bar.

The bill would revise the definition of port facilities to specifically reference airports, landports, waterports, and railports.
(2) Existing law authorizes the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development and its director to expend funds relating to the Economic Adjustment Assistance Grant funded through the United States Economic Development Administration.
This bill would repeal these provisions, and would specify that, effective June 30, 2014, those funds are transferred to the Valley Economic Development Corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions agreed to by the United States Economic Development Administration, the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, and the Valley Economic Development Center, Inc., on June 17, 2014.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 21, 2014.

"Existing law provides for the annual assessment and collection of property taxes by each county, and provides for the state administration of the property tax by the State Board of Equalization.
The California Constitution generally limits ad valorem taxes on real property to 1% of the full cash value of that property. For purposes of this limitation, “full cash value” is defined as the assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975–76 tax bill under “full cash value” or, thereafter, the appraised value of that real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred.
Existing property tax law requires a transferee of real property or a manufactured home that is locally assessed to file a change in ownership statement with the assessor of the county in which the property or manufactured home is located, and also requires a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other legal entity to file a change in ownership statement with the board.
Existing property tax law also includes various property tax exemptions as authorized or established by the California Constitution.
This bill would prohibit an assessor or any person employed by the office of the county assessor from making decisions with regard to change in ownership, or with regard to property tax exemptions, except a homeowners’ exemption claim, unless he or she is the holder of a valid assessment analyst certificate issued by the board. The bill would require the board to provide for the examination of applicants for a certificate and would authorize the board to contract with the Department of Human Resources to give the examinations. The bill would require prescribed annual training for certification, and would also provide for advanced certification. Failure to complete training as required would be grounds for revocation. The bill would also authorize the board to issue temporary certificates and interim certificates under prescribed circumstances. This bill would specify that its provisions are not to be construed to impede assessors from managing their staff resources efficiently regarding exemption applications and change in ownership documents, provided that noncertificated staff are not responsible for making exemption or change in ownership decisions.

Existing law sets forth procedures for voting by military or overseas voters, as defined, and permits a military or overseas voter to return his or her ballot by facsimile transmission, accompanied by an oath of voter declaration that includes the voter’s signature. Existing law prescribes the contents of the oath of voter declaration and requires, among other things, the voter to provide his or her current mailing address.
The bill would modify the oath of voter declaration form to indicate that the residence address is the last U.S. residence for voter qualification purposes.
Existing law permits a district to conduct an election by all-mailed ballots. Existing law also permits political subdivisions to consolidate their elections in certain circumstances.
The bill would permit a district conducting an election by all-mailed ballots to consolidate its election with one or more other political subdivisions that are also conducting their elections wholly by mail, if certain conditions are satisfied.
Existing law permits the governing body of a special district to consolidate its elections of governing body members in November of odd-numbered years with the statewide general election.

"Existing law requires the State Registrar to administer the registration of births, deaths, fetal deaths, and marriages. Existing law requires the State Registrar to arrange and permanently preserve the certificates in a systematic manner and to prepare and maintain a comprehensive and continuous index of all certificates registered. Existing law requires that specified birth, death, and marriage record indices prepared or maintained by local registrars and county recorders be kept confidential. Existing law requires, notwithstanding these provisions, local registrars and county recorders to release, when requested, their comprehensive birth, death, and nonconfidential marriage record indices to the State Registrar.
This bill would additionally authorize the local registrar to release birth and death record indices to the county recorder within its jurisdiction for purposes of the preparation or maintenance of the indices of the county recorder. The bill would extend application of specified access restrictions applicable to confidential portions of certificates of live birth to confidential birth record indices.
Existing law prescribes specified personal information to be included on birth, death, and marriage certificates. Under existing law, a certified copy of a birth or death record may only be supplied by the State Registrar, local registrar, or county recorder to an authorized person, as defined, who submits a statement sworn under penalty of perjury that the applicant is an authorized person. Existing law also requires that each certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record contain specified information and be printed on sensitized security paper with specified security features, including, among others, intaglio print.
This bill would authorize the State Registrar to suspend the use of any security feature if necessary to enable the State Registrar, local registrar, county recorder, or county clerk to supply an applicant with a certified copy of a birth, death, or marriage record. The bill would authorize the State Department of Public Health to implement this provision through all-county letters or similar instructions, as specified.
Existing law requires the State Registrar to appoint a Vital Records Protection Advisory Committee to study and make recommendations to protect individual privacy, inhibit identity theft, and prevent fraud involving birth, death, and marriage certificates while providing needed access to the information contained in those records by persons seeking it for a legitimate purpose.
This bill would require the State Registrar, in consultation with the County Recorders’ Association of California and other stakeholders, to study all security features for paper used to print a vital record, or alternative security features that are equal to or better than those that are currently mandated. The bill would require the State Registrar to submit a report to the Legislature, on or before January 1, 2018, that contains the findings of that study and legislative recommendations pertaining to those findings.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","Provides that the birth, death, and marriage record indices prepared pursuant to this Act and all comprehensive birth, death, and marriage record indices prepared or maintained by local registrars and county recorders shall be kept confidential and shall be exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act.

"Existing law, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, an initiative measure enacted by the approval of Proposition 215 at the November 5, 1996, statewide general election, authorizes the use and cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes. Existing law makes it a crime to plant, cultivate, harvest, dry, or process marijuana, except as otherwise authorized by law. Under existing law, qualified patients, persons with valid identification cards, and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients and persons with identification cards, who associate in order collectively and cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, are not subject to criminal sanctions solely on the basis of that fact.
The Fee Collection Procedures Law, among other things, provides for the administration of fee programs by the State Board of Equalization, establishes procedures for collection, reporting, return, refund, and appeals, and authorizes the board to adopt regulations relating to administration and enforcement of the law. The Fee Collection Procedures Law establishes criminal penalties for specified acts, including making it a misdemeanor to knowingly or willfully file a false return and making it a felony to willfully evade or attempt to evade or defeat the payment of a fee.
This bill would impose a tax in specified amounts on the distribution in this state by a cultivator, as defined, of marijuana flowers, marijuana leaves, and immature marijuana plants to a licensed distributor, as specified, and would require the licensed distributor to collect the tax from the cultivator and remit it to the board. The bill would require the board to collect the tax pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Fee Collection Procedures Law. The bill would require all moneys, less refunds and costs of administration, to be deposited into the Marijuana Production and Environment Mitigation Fund, which this bill would establish in the State Treasury, and would continuously appropriate the moneys in that fund to the board for allocation, as specified.
By expanding the application of the Fee Collection Procedures Law, which imposes criminal penalties for various acts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
This bill would include a change in state statute that would result in a taxpayer paying a higher tax within the meaning of Section 3 of Article XIII A of the California Constitution, and thus would require for passage the approval of
2/3
of the membership of each house of the Legislature.","Medical Marijuana Tax Law This bill amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to: impose a tax on the sale of marijuana flowers, marijuana leaves, and immature marijuana plants; and require a licensed distributor of marijuana to collect such tax and pay it separately."
"Existing law prohibits state trust funds, as defined, from making, holding, or renewing investments in business firms or financial institutions that engage in discriminatory business practices in furtherance of, or in compliance with, the Arab League’s economic boycott of Israel, as specified. Existing law also prohibits state moneys, as defined, from being deposited with financial institutions that engage in those discriminatory business practices.
This bill would enact the California Israel Commerce Protection Act. The bill would additionally apply those prohibitions to investment in business firms or financial institutions that engage in discriminatory business practices in furtherance or in compliance with the boycott of Israel, as defined. The bill would require state trust funds to use the most recent federal report on politically motivated acts of boycott, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel to determine which business firms and financial institutions engage in those practices. The bill would make conforming changes and related findings and declarations.","California Israel Commerce Protection Act This bill declares that it is unconscionable for California to invest in companies that boycott Israel, as California has long standing social, political, and economic partnerships with Israel. The bill defines &quot;investment&quot; as the commitment of funds or other assets to a business firm, including a loan or other extension of credit made to that firm, or security given for other assets to that business enterprise, or the beneficial ownership or control of that business firm or of a bond or other debt instrument issued by that business firm. The bill prohibits state trust moneys and public retirement systems from being used to invest in any business firm that boycotts Israel."

Existing law conforms to these federal income tax law provisions relating to the ABLE Act under the Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law, as provided. Existing law defines “eligible individual” for these purposes. Existing law establishes in state government the ABLE program trust for purposes of implementing the federal ABLE Act. Existing law also establishes the ABLE Act Board and authorizes the board to adopt regulations to implement the program.
The existing State Contract Act, in connection with contracts entered into by any state agency for services to be rendered to the state, prohibits a person, firm, or subsidiary thereof that has been awarded a consulting services contract from submitting a bid for, or being awarded a contract for, the provision of services, the procurement of goods or supplies, or any other related action that is required, suggested, or otherwise deemed appropriate in the end product of the consulting services contract. A willful violation of these provisions is a misdemeanor, under other provisions.
This bill would modify the definition of “eligible individual.” The bill would also exempt the ABLE Act Board from the above prohibition in the State Contract Act for a contract with a program consultant for the qualified ABLE program but would require such a contract to be publicly disclosed in a manner specified by the board prior to entering into the contract.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to create&nbsp;the California ABLE Program Trust, the purposes, powers, and duties of which shall be exercised by the California ABLE Act Board. The purposes, powers, and duties of the board shall include: advising designated beneficiaries or eligible individuals regarding present and estimated future qualified disability expenses and the levels of financial participation in the ABLE program trust required in order to assist designated beneficiaries or eligible individuals in meeting their qualified disability expenses; and conducting related studies and projections."

The act authorizes and requires the governing board of a school district to charge certain fees for use of its school facilities or grounds.
This bill would specifically authorize a governing board of a school district to authorize the use of school facilities or grounds by a nonprofit organization, or by a club or an association organized to promote youth and school activities, that is a recreational youth sports league that charges participants an average of no more than $60 per month.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced.

This bill would authorize the board, in the case of a disaster, as defined, to allow an extension for up to 3 months under the same conditions as the extension for good cause.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to allow the board for good cause to extend the time for filing tax returns and paying taxes, except in the case of a disaster, for up to one month if: (1) a state budget has not been adopted by July 1; and (2) a creditor of a state who has not been paid because of such failure has requested an extension but the state has not adopted the budget. Requires an extension to expire at the last day of the month following the month in which the budget is adopted or one month from the due date of the tax return or payment, whichever comes later.

"Existing law regulates the sale or offer to sell by a dealer to a consumer of a collectible in or from this state, as specified. Existing law defines the term “collectible” to mean an autographed sports item, as specified, sold or offered for sale in or from this state by a dealer to a consumer for $5 or more. Existing law defines a “dealer” as, among other things, a person who is in the business of selling or offering for sale collectibles in or from this state, or a person who by his or her occupation holds himself or herself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to collectibles.
Existing law provides for the regulation of pawnbrokers and makes it unlawful for a person to engage in the business of a pawnbroker without a license issued by the chief of police, the sheriff, or where appropriate, the police commission.
This bill would instead define the term “collectible” to mean all autographed items, whether or not sports related, as specified, and would make conforming changes to the provisions regulating the sale or offer to sell by a dealer to a consumer of a collectible in this state. The bill would exclude a pawnbroker licensed pursuant to a specified law, under specified circumstances, the personality who signs the memorabilia, and a provider or operator of an online marketplace, as specified, from the definition of a dealer.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2010.

Existing law provides that enrollment and participation in, and completion of, an approved program shall be subsequent to the date of the current violation. Existing law requires a county alcohol program administrator to coordinate court-established reporting requirements with the Department of Motor Vehicles and the State Department of Health Care Services.
This bill would require that enrollment in an approved program take place within 30 days of conviction, unless an extension of no longer than 30 days is granted by the court, as specified. The bill would also require the court, for first time offenders, to consider a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08% or more, by weight, in combination with the presence of a Schedule I or II controlled substance, as defined,
except for marijuana or a controlled substance prescribed by a licensed physician or dentist,
as an aggravating factor that may justify enhancing the terms and conditions of probation, as specified. The bill would require the county alcohol program administrator to additionally coordinate court referral and tracking documents with the Department of Motor Vehicles and the State Department of Health Care Services. By imposing new duties on a county employee, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
Existing law authorizes a court, as a condition of probation, to refer a person convicted for driving under the influence to a licensed program, as specified, even though the person’s privilege to operate a motor vehicle is restricted, suspended, or revoked. Existing law requires a clerk of the court to indicate the duration of the treatment program the judge has ordered a person to participate in the abstract of the court record that is forwarded to the State Department of Health Care Services.

Existing law provides that these provisions are inoperative on January 1, 2017, and that a hospital is not required to pay the hospital quality assurance fee after that date, as specified.
This bill would extend the operation of these provisions to January 1, 2018. The bill would instead, for the second program period and subsequent program periods, require moneys in the Hospital Quality Assurance Revenue Fund to be continuously appropriated, thereby making an appropriation, for the above-described purposes.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.

"Existing law with respect to claims against public entities authorizes the “board,” as defined, to assess a surcharge to the state entity against which an approved claim was filed in an amount not to exceed 15% of the claim. Existing law requires the surcharge to be deposited into the General Fund and provides that it may be appropriated in support of the board in the annual Budget Act.
This bill would specify that the Department of General Services may assess this surcharge, would require the surcharge to be deposited into the Service Revolving Fund, and would specify that the surcharge may be appropriated to the department in the annual Budget Act.
Existing law defines a human trafficking caseworker to mean a human trafficking caseworker as defined by the Evidence Code.
This bill would expand that definition to include a human trafficking caseworker who is employed by a homeless services provider that serves homeless children or youth and has completed a minimum of 8 hours of training focused on victims of human trafficking from the Runaway and Homeless Youth Training and Technical Assistance Center.

"(1) The Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, imposes a 1% tax on that portion of a taxpayer’s taxable income that exceeds $1,000,000 and requires that the revenue from that tax be deposited in the Mental Health Services Fund to fund various county mental health programs. The MHSA authorizes the Legislature to amend its provisions by a
2/3
vote, provided that the amendment is consistent with and furthers the intent of the act.
Existing law, known as the No Place Like Home Program, requires the Department of Housing and Community Development to award $2,000,000,000 among counties to finance capital costs, including, but not limited to, acquisition, design, construction, rehabilitation, or preservation, and to capitalize operating reserves, of permanent supportive housing for the target population, as specified. Existing law requires the department to distribute $1,800,000,000 through a competitive program and to allocate $200,000,000 among all counties within this state on an “over-the-counter” population basis.
The bill would authorize the California Health Facilities Financing Authority and the department to, among other things, enter into contracts to provide services pursuant to the No Place Like Home Program related to permanent supportive housing. The bill would also authorize the authority to issue taxable or tax-exempt revenue bonds in an amount not to exceed $2,000,000,000 for these purposes and to make secured or unsecured loans to the department in connection with financing permanent supportive housing pursuant to the No Place Like Home Program. The bill would require that the dollar limit on amounts distributed under the No Place Like Home Program be based on the principal amount of bonds issued by the authority and loaned to the department.
The bill would additionally authorize the use of moneys in the Mental Health Services Fund for the purposes of the No Place Like Home Program. The bill would also establish and continuously appropriate the Supportive Housing Program Subaccount in the Mental Health Services Fund. The bill would require the Controller, no later than the last day of each month and prior to any transfer or expenditure from the fund for any other purpose for the following month, to transfer from the Mental Health Services Fund to the Supportive Housing Program Subaccount an amount necessary to cover the costs the authority is required to pay to the department pursuant to an above-described service contract, as determined by the authority but not to exceed an aggregate amount of $140,000,000 per year. The bill would prohibit moneys in the Supportive Housing Program Subaccount from being loaned to the General Fund pursuant to specified statutes.
The bill would exempt service contracts between the department and the authority pursuant to these provisions from specified public contracting laws. The bill would also exempt loan agreements between the department and the authority and revenue bonds issued by the authority from any other law applicable to the execution of those agreements or issuance of those bonds, including the California Environmental Quality Act.
(2) Existing law establishes the No Place Like Home Fund and continuously appropriates the moneys in this fund to the Department of Housing and Community Development for the purposes of the No Place Like Home Program. Existing law requires the deposit into the fund of, among other moneys, any proceeds from the issuance of bonds by the Treasurer.
This bill would instead require the department to deposit into the fund the proceeds of loans derived from the issuance of bonds under this bill by the California Health Facilities Financing Authority. The bill would additionally continuously appropriate moneys in the fund to the Treasurer and the authority for purposes of the No Place Like Home Program.
(3) Existing law requires counties to annually report specified information to the Department of Housing and Community Development on activities funded under the No Place Like Home Program, including information on the funded supportive housing development. Existing law also requires the department to report specified information on the program to the Legislature by December 31 of each year, commencing with the year after the first full year in which the program is in effect.
This bill would require the department to monitor county compliance with applicable program regulations, loan agreements and regulatory agreements and any agreements related to the program that designate the department as a 3rd party beneficiary, and enforce those agreements to the extent necessary and desirable in order to provide, to the greatest degree possible, the successful provision of permanent supportive housing. The bill would require the department to submit a report to the California Health Facilities Financing Authority by December 31 of each year, commencing with the year after the first full year in which the program is in effect, that contains specified information about the counties participating in the program and the services that have been provided pursuant to any service contracts between the department and the authority, as described above.
(4) Existing law establishes a procedure by which a public agency may bring an action in the superior court to determine the validity of any matter authorized by other law. Existing law authorizes an action under this procedure to determine the legality of any action by the Department of Housing and Community Development related to the No Place Like Home Program. Existing law requires the department to issue its first request for proposal for the competitive program no later than 180 days, and to make its first allocation of “over-the-counter” funds within 60 days, after the deadline for appeals under the validation procedure.
This bill would recast this authorization to instead authorize an action to determine the validity of any service contract or loan agreement between the department and the California Health Facilities Financing Authority, as described above, in accordance with specified provisions governing actions to determine the validity of bonds, warrants, contracts, obligations, or evidences of indebtedness. The bill would instead require the department to issue its first request for proposal no later than 180 days, and to make its first allocation of “over-the-counter” funds as soon as reasonably practical, but no later than 150 days, after the effective date of a final judgment with no further opportunity for appeals, in any court proceeding affirming the validity of the service contracts between the department and the authority and any bonds issued by the authority.
(5) Existing law authorizes the Department of Finance to authorize a loan from the General Fund to the No Place Like Home Fund for cashflow purposes in an amount not to exceed $1,000,000. Existing law requires that a loan comply with certain requirements, including that the purpose of the loan is to allow the department to begin implementation activities related to the No Place Like Home Program, including drafting program guidelines and regulations.
This bill would instead authorize the Department of Finance to authorize one or more loans from the General Fund to the No Place Like Home Fund in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2,000,000. The bill would additionally authorize loans for the purpose of allowing the Department of Housing and Community Development, the California Health Facilities Financing Authority, and the Treasurer to implement the above-described provisions pertaining to service contracts and loan agreements between the department and the authority and revenue bonds issued by the authority.
(6) Existing law makes various findings and declarations regarding the No Place Like Home Program.
This bill would make additional findings and declarations pertaining to the financing and implementation of the No Place Like Home Program. The bill would also make various technical and conforming changes to the No Place Like Home Program.

"The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA) requires a public retirement system, as defined, to modify its plan or plans to comply with the act and, among other provisions, establishes new retirement formulas that may not be exceeded by a public employer offering a defined benefit pension plan for employees first hired on or after January 1, 2013. PEPRA exempts from its provisions certain public employees whose collective bargaining rights are subject to specified provisions of federal law until a specified federal district court decision on a certification by the United States Secretary of Labor, or until January 1, 2016, whichever is sooner.
This bill would extend indefinitely that exemption for those public employees, whose collective bargaining rights are subject to specified provisions of federal law and who became a member of a state or local public retirement system prior to December 30, 2014.
The bill would exempt these employees from PEPRA without regard to date of hire upon issuance of a specified federal district court decision.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 16, 2012.

To the extent this bill would impose additional duties on school districts or county offices of education, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Education Code, with respect to the approval of charter schools, to set forth criteria for renewal of charter schools, including: (1) consideration of increases in pupil academic achievement for all groups of pupils served by the charter school; (2) a determination by the chartering authority that the charter school is at least equal to the academic performance of the public schools in the school district in which the charter school pupils would otherwise have been required to attend, as well as the academic performance of the schools in the school district served at the charter school; and (3) qualified for an alternative accountability system."

Qualified individuals under the Medi-Cal program include medically needy persons and medically needy family persons wonal needs allowance amount from $35 to $80 per month while a person is a patient as described above, and instead would require the department to annually increase this amount based on the percentage increase in the California Consumer Price Index. Because counties are required to make Medi-Cal eligibility determinations, and this bill would expand eligibility by increasing the personal needs allowance and would increase the responsibility of counties in determining Medi-Cal eligibility, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

The prima facie limit also applies when approaching or passing school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with a standard “SCHOOL” warning sign. A violation of that prima facie limit is an infraction.
Existing law additionally allows a city or county to establish in a residence district, on a highway with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, a 15 miles per hour prima facie limit when approaching, at a distance of less than 500 feet from, or passing, a school building or the grounds thereof, contiguous to a highway and posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 15 miles per hour, while children are going to or leaving the school, either during school hours or during the noon recess period. The prima facie limit would also apply when approaching, at that same distance, or passing school grounds that are not separated from the highway by a fence, gate, or other physical barrier while the grounds are in use by children and the highway is posted with one of those signs.
Existing law additionally allows a city or county to establish in a residence district, on a highway with a posted speed limit of 30 miles per hour or slower, a 25 miles per hour prima facie speed limit when approaching at a distance of 500 to 1,000 feet from a school building or grounds thereof, contiguous to a highway and posted with a school warning sign that indicates a speed limit of 25 miles per hour, while children are going to or leaving the school, either during school hours or during the noon recess period.

This bill would also authorize a local authority, on the basis of an engineering and traffic survey, to extend the maximum distance up to one mile to establish a prima facie speed limit and school warning signs, as specified.
By authorizing a change in the prima facie limits, the bill would expand the scope of an existing crime, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.

Existing federal law requires the operator of an unmanned aircraft system to immediately, and by the most expeditious means available, notify the nearest National Transportation Safety Board office when, among other things, an aircraft accident, as defined, or certain serious incidents occur. Those notifications are required to include, among other things, the name of the owner of the unmanned aircraft system, the name of the operator of the unmanned aircraft system, the date and time of the accident, and the nature of the accident.
Existing state law requires the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to any person, other than himself or herself, or in the death of any person, to immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident and provide certain information and render assistance, as necessary, to the driver and occupants of the other vehicle and provide the specified information to any traffic or police officer at the scene of the accident. A person who violates this requirement is guilty of a misdemeanor or a felony. Existing law requires the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting only in damage to any property, including vehicles, to immediately stop the vehicle at the nearest location that will not impede traffic or otherwise jeopardize the safety of other motorists and provide certain information to the owner or person in charge of the damaged property or place that information in a conspicuous place on the damaged property. A person who violates this requirement is guilty of a misdemeanor.
This bill would require, except as specified, the operator of any unmanned aircraft system involved in an accident resulting in injury to an individual or damage to property to immediately land the unmanned aircraft at the nearest location that will not jeopardize the safety of others and provide certain information to the injured individual or the owner or person in charge of the damaged property or place that information in a conspicuous place on the damaged property. The bill would make a person who knowingly fails to comply with these provisions guilty of an infraction or a misdemeanor, as specified. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

several
specified attributes, including, for rifles, a thumbhole stock, and for pistols, a 2nd handgrip.
This bill would revise this definition of “assault weapon” to mean a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or a semiautomatic pistol that does not have a fixed magazine but has any one of those specified attributes. The bill would also define “fixed magazine” to mean an ammunition feeding device contained in, or permanently attached to, a firearm in such a manner that the device cannot be removed without disassembly of the firearm action.
By expanding the definition of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law makes any person who, within this state, possesses an assault weapon, except as otherwise provided, guilty of a misdemeanor or a felony.
This bill would exempt from punishment under that prohibition a person who possessed an assault weapon prior to January 1, 2017, if specified requirements are met.
(3) Existing law requires that, with specified exceptions, any person who, prior to January 1, 2001, lawfully possessed an assault weapon prior to the date it was defined as an assault weapon, and which was not specified as an assault weapon at the time of lawful possession, register the firearm with the Department of Justice. Existing law permits the Department of Justice to charge a fee for registration of up to $20 per person but not to exceed the actual processing costs of the department. Existing law, after the department establishes fees sufficient to reimburse the department for processing costs, requires fees charged to increase at a rate not to exceed the legislatively approved annual cost-of-living adjustment for the department’s budget or as otherwise increased through the Budget Act. Existing law requires those fees to be deposited into the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account. Existing law, the Administrative Procedure Act, establishes the requirements for the adoption, publication, review, and implementation of regulations by state agencies.
This bill would require that any person who, from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2016, inclusive, lawfully possessed an assault weapon that does not have a fixed magazine, as defined,

including those weapons with an ammunition feeding device that can be removed readily from the firearm with the use of a tool, register the firearm with the Department of Justice before January 1, 2018, but not before the effective date of specified regulations. The bill would permit the department to increase the $20 registration fee as long as it does not exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. The bill would also require registrations to be submitted electronically via the Internet utilizing a public-facing application made available by the department. The bill would require the registration to contain specified information, including, but not limited to, a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely and specified information about the registrant. The bill would permit the department to charge a fee of up to $15 per person for registration through the Internet, not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department to be paid and deposited, as specified, for purposes of the registration program. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing those provisions and would exempt those regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would also make technical and conforming changes.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(5) This bill would become operative only if SB 880 of the 2015–16 Regular Session is enacted and takes effect on or before January 1, 2017.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on October 19, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the federal criminal code to revise the definition of &quot;assault weapon,&quot; for purposes of the prohibition against manufacturing, transferring, or possessing a firearm or ammunition, to include: a semiautomatic rifle that has a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds; a semiautomatic rifle that has an overall length of less than 30 inches; a semiautomatic pistol that does not have a fixed magazine but has any one of the following: a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon; a thumbhole stock; a folding or telescoping stock; a grenade launcher or flare launcher; a flash suppressor; a forward pistol grip; a semiautomatic shotgun that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine; and any shotgun with a revolving cylinder. The bill excludes: any antique firearm possessed because it is consistent with the significant public purpose expressed in specified statutes; and specified pistols used by the International Olympic Committee and by USA Shooting, the national governing body for international shooting competition in the United States, and that would otherwise fall within the definition of &quot;assault weapon,&quot; as provided by the bill.

"Existing law, the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, prohibits a person from introducing into interstate commerce any new drug unless the drug has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Existing law requires the sponsor of a new drug to submit to the FDA an investigational new drug application and to then conduct a series of clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug in human populations and submit the results to the FDA in a new drug application.
Existing law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, regulates the packaging, labeling, and advertising of drugs and devices and is administered by the State Department of Public Health. A violation of that law is a crime. The Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law prohibits, among other things, the sale, delivery, or giving away of a new drug or new device unless either the department has approved a new drug or device application for that new drug or new device and that approval has not been withdrawn, terminated, or suspended or the drug or device has been approved pursuant to specified provisions of federal law, including the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
The Medical Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians and surgeons by the Medical Board of California and requires the board to take action against a licensee who is charged with unprofessional conduct. The Osteopathic Act provides for the licensure and regulation of osteopathic physicians and surgeons by the Osteopathic Medical Board of California and requires the board to enforce the Medical Practice Act with respect to its licensees.
This bill would permit a manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological product, or device to make the product available to eligible patients with an immediately life-threatening disease or condition, as specified. The bill would authorize, but not require, a health benefit plan, as defined, to provide coverage for any investigational drug, biological product, or device made available pursuant to these provisions. The bill would prohibit the Medical Board of California and the Osteopathic Medical Board of California from taking any disciplinary action against the license of a physician based on the physician’s recommendation to an eligible patient regarding, or prescription for, or treatment with, an investigational drug, biological product, or device if the recommendation or prescription is consistent with protocol approved by the physician’s institutional review board or an accredited institutional review board, and would require the institutional review board to biannually report specified information to the State Department of Public Health, among others. The bill would prohibit a state agency from altering any recommendation made to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding a health care provider’s certification to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid program based solely on the recommendation from an individual health care provider that a patient have access to an investigational drug, biological product, or device.","Right to Try Act - Requires a primary physician and an osteopathic physician licensed under the Medical Practice Act or an osteopathic physician licensed under the Osteopathic Act to Confirm, in writing, that an eligible patient is competent, acting voluntarily, and has made an informed decision if the physician determines that such patient: (1) has an immediately life-threatening disease or condition; (2) has considered all other treatment options currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); (3) has not been accepted to participate in the nearest clinical trial to his or her home for such disease or condition within one week of completion of the clinical trial application process; (4) has received a recommendation from his or her primary physician and a consulting physician for an investigational drug, biological product, or device; (5) has given written informed consent for the use of such investigational drug, biological product, or device; and (6) has documentation from his or her primary physician and a consulting physician attesting that the patient has met the requirements of this Act.

"Existing law requires a local government agency letting a public transit service contract out to bid to give a bidding preference for contractors and subcontractors who agree to retain for a specified period certain employees who were employed to perform essentially the same services by the previous contractor or subcontractor. Such a contractor or subcontractor is required to offer employment to those employees, except for reasonable and substantiated cause. Existing law requires a successor contractor or subcontractor that determines that fewer employees are needed than under the prior contract to retain qualified employees by seniority within the job classification. The existing contractor is required to provide prescribed information regarding employment under the existing service contract to the awarding authority, any entity that the awarding authority identifies as a bona fide bidder, and the successor contractor. Existing law authorizes an employee who was not offered employment or who has been discharged in violation of existing law, or his or her agent, to bring an action against the successor contractor or subcontractor in any superior court having jurisdiction over the successor contractor or subcontractor. Existing law authorizes an awarding authority to terminate a service contract under prescribed circumstances.
This bill would expand the application of these provisions to exclusive contracts for the collection and transportation of solid waste. The bill would require the information provided to a bona fide bidder to be made available in writing at least 30 days before bids for the service contract are due. The bill would establish certain provisions applicable only to service contracts for the collection and transportation of solid waste, including limits on the requirement to retain employees and specified requirements for notice and opportunity to cure in the context of civil action or termination. The bill would not apply to contracts awarded before January 1, 2017, or to contracts for which the bid process has been completed before January 1, 2017. By requiring local agencies to give a bidding preference under these provisions to those contractors and subcontractors for the collection and transportation of solid waste, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Labor Code to allow an awarding authority, when awarding a service contract for the collection and transportation of solid waste, to give a ten percent preference to any bidder who agrees to retain the employees of the prior contractor or subcontractor."
"(1) Existing law makes it a crime, subject to specified exemptions, for a person to intentionally eavesdrop upon or record a confidential communication by means of an electronic amplifying or recording device without the consent of all parties to the confidential communication. Existing law defines a confidential communication as any communication carried on in circumstances that reasonably indicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined to the parties thereto. Existing law exempts from the prohibition the recording of a confidential communication made for the purpose of obtaining evidence reasonably believed to relate to the commission by another party to the communication of certain crimes, including any felony involving violence against the person making the recording.
This bill additionally would make it a crime for a person who unlawfully eavesdrops upon or records a confidential communication as described above with a health care provider, as defined, to intentionally disclose or distribute the contents of the confidential communication without the consent of all parties to the confidential communication unless specified conditions are met. The bill would make this prohibition subject to the same exemptions as are applicable to the prohibition on eavesdropping upon or recording a confidential communication as described above. The bill would also specify the conduct that constitutes aiding and abetting the commission of those offenses, as specified. The bill would specify, with respect to the exemption for recording communications believed to relate to the commission of a crime by a party to the communication, that a felony involving violence includes human trafficking, as defined. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law authorizes any person who has been injured by a violation of the prohibition on eavesdropping upon or recording confidential communications, and related offenses, to bring an action against the person who committed the violation to enjoin and restrain the violation, as well as to bring an action for monetary damages, as specified.
This bill would provide that the monetary damages be imposed per violation of the above-described provisions.
(3) Existing law makes the above-specified crime of eavesdropping punishable by a fine not to exceed $2,500 or imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state prison for 16 months or 2 or 3 years. If the person has previously been convicted of eavesdropping, or has previously been convicted of specified invasion of privacy crimes, existing law requires the person to be punished by a fine not exceeding $10,000, by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or in the state prison for 16 months or 2 or 3 years.
This bill would require the above-specified fines to be imposed on a per-violation basis and would impose the same penalties prescribed for the unlawful eavesdropping upon or recording of a confidential communication to the disclosure crimes created by the bill. The bill also would make various technical, nonsubstantive changes to existing law.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2003.

"Existing law generally regulates the transfer and possession of firearms. Existing law defines the term “firearm” for various regulatory purposes, including, among others and subject to exceptions, the requirement that firearms be transferred by or through a licensed firearms dealer, the requirement of a 10-day waiting period prior to delivery of a firearm by a dealer, the requirement that firearm purchasers be subject to a background check, and the prohibition on certain classes of persons, such as felons, possessing firearms. Under existing law, the term “firearm” includes the frame or receiver of the weapon. Existing law makes a violation of certain of these prohibitions a crime.
This bill would define a frame or receiver as that part of a firearm which provides housing for the hammer, bolt, or breechblock, and firing mechanism, and which is usually threaded at its forward portion to receive the barrel, and would include within this definition a frame or receiver blank, casting, or machined body that requires further machining or molding to be used as part of a functional weapon so long as it has been designed and is clearly identifiable as being used exclusively as part of a functional weapon.
By expanding the scope of existing crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 16520 of the Penal Code proposed by SB 894, SB 1407, and AB 857 which would become operative if this bill and those bills are enacted, as specified, and this bill is enacted last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Federal criminal code to revise the definition of ""firearm"" to: (1) include the frame or receiver of the weapon; (2) include a rocket, rocket propelled projectile launcher, or similar device containing an explosive or incendiary material, whether or not the device is designed for emergency or distress signaling purposes; and (3) exclude an unloaded antique firearm."
"Existing law, subject to exceptions, prohibits a person from making more than one application to purchase a handgun within any 30-day period. Violation of that prohibition is a crime. Existing law exempts from that prohibition a firearms transaction where neither of the parties is a firearms dealer if the transaction is completed through a dealer. Existing law prohibits a firearms dealer from delivering a handgun to a person whenever the dealer is notified by the Department of Justice that within the preceding 30-day period the purchaser has made another application to purchase a handgun that does not fall within an exception to the 30-day prohibition. A violation of that delivery prohibition by the dealer is a crime.
This bill would make the 30-day prohibition and the dealer delivery prohibition described above applicable to all types of firearms. The bill would delete the private party transaction exemption to the 30-day prohibition and instead would exempt from that prohibition the transfer of a firearm conducted through a licensed firearms dealer if the firearm is being transferred by bequest or intestate succession, the purchase of a firearm that is not a handgun or a finished frame or receiver by a licensed hunter, and the purchase of a firearm from a nonprofit entity conducting an auction or similar event, as specified. The bill would make additional conforming changes and technical, nonsubstantive changes.
By expanding the scope of existing crimes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would incorporate changes to Sections 26835 and 27535 of the Penal Code proposed by both this bill and SB 894, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

"Existing law generally prohibits an employer from paying an employee at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex in the same establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions. Existing law establishes exceptions to that prohibition, including, among others, where the payment is made based on any bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training, or experience. Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for an employer or other person acting either individually or as an officer, agent, or employee of another person to pay or cause to be paid to any employee a wage less than the rate paid to an employee of the opposite sex as required by these provisions, or who reduces the wages of any employee in order to comply with these provisions. Existing law also makes it a misdemeanor for an employer to refuse or neglect to comply with the above provisions of law.
This bill would specify that prior salary cannot, by itself, justify any disparity in compensation under the bona fide factor exception to the above prohibition. By changing the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would incorporate additional changes in Section 1197.5 of the Labor Code proposed by SB 1063 that would become operative only if SB 1063 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.

"Existing law requires state and local law enforcement agencies to provide, without charging a fee, one copy of all domestic violence incident report face sheets and one copy of all domestic violence incident reports, or both, to a victim of domestic violence, as defined, or to his or her personal representative, as defined, upon request.
This bill would also require state or local law enforcement agencies to provide a copy of those reports to a victim of sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, or abuse of an elder or a dependent adult, as defined. The bill would define “victim” for these purposes to include a minor who is 12 years of age or older. The bill would require these provisions to apply to requests for reports made within 2 years from the date of completion of the sexual assault, stalking, human trafficking, or abuse of an elder or a dependent adult incident report. This bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions. By increasing the duties of local law enforcement agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

The act prohibits the sales and use tax exclusions
for these projects
from exceeding $100,000,000 for each calendar year.

"(1) Existing law requires the State Air Resources Board to adopt and implement standards for the control of emissions from new motor vehicles that the state board finds to be necessary and technologically feasible. Existing law prohibits a new motor vehicle from being sold in the state that does not meet the emissions standards adopted by the state board. Existing law provides that a person who violates specified vehicular air pollution statutes or specified orders, rules, or regulations of the state board is subject to a civil penalty of up to $500 per vehicle. Existing law provides that any manufacturer who sells, attempts to sell, or causes to be offered for sale a new motor vehicle that fails to meet the applicable emission standards is subject to a civil penalty of $5,000 per violation. Existing law provides that a manufacturer or distributor who does not comply with the emission standards or the test procedures adopted by the state board is subject to a civil penalty of $50 per vehicle.
This bill would increase those penalties to up to $37,500 per violation. The bill would require the state board to adjust those maximum penalties for inflation, as specified, and would exempt those adjustments from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would authorize the state board to require the payment of a penalty for the violation of specified vehicular air pollution statutes or specified orders, rules, or regulations of the state board, and making the products compliant with specified laws, as conditions for the continued sale of those products.
This bill would authorize the state board to order a manufacturer of motor vehicles to bring the vehicles into compliance with the emissions configuration to which they were certified. The bill would authorize the state board to require the manufacturer to be in compliance with the state board’s order as a condition for the continued sale of motor vehicles in the state.
(2) Existing law prohibits a person who is a state resident or who operates an established place of business within the state from importing, delivering, purchasing, renting, leasing, acquiring, or receiving a new motor vehicle, new motor vehicle engine, or motor vehicle with a new motor vehicle engine for use, registration, or resale in the state unless the motor vehicle engine or new motor vehicle has been certified to meet specified emissions standards. Existing law provides that a person who violates specified provisions relating to transactions of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines is subject to a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per vehicle.
This bill instead would prohibit any person from offering for sale, introducing into commerce, importing, delivering, purchasing, renting, leasing, acquiring, or receiving a new motor vehicle, new motor vehicle engine, or motor vehicle with a new motor vehicle engine for use, registration, or resale in the state unless the motor vehicle engine or new motor vehicle has been certified to meet those specified emissions standards.
This bill would increase the civil penalty to up to $37,500 per violation and up to $10,000 for a dealer, as defined, for violating those specified provisions relating to transactions of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.

Existing law authorizes the parent or guardian to object to the placement.
This bill would require that the notice also be served on the child’s attorney and, if the child is 10 years of age or older, on the child, and would authorize the child to object to the placement.

"(1) Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary schools in this state, and authorizes local educational agencies throughout the state to operate schools and provide instruction to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. Existing law prescribes the course of study a pupil is required to complete while in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school. These requirements include the completion of 3 courses in social studies, including one-year courses in United States history and geography and world history, culture, and geography, and one-semester courses in American government and economics.
This bill would express legislative findings and declarations relating to service learning. The bill would additionally require, commencing with the high school class graduating during the 2021–22 school year, and for the high school classes graduating in each subsequent school year, at least one of the courses completed by a pupil to satisfy the graduation requirements referenced above to have a service learning component. The bill would define “service learning” for this purpose.
The bill would require the Superintendent of Public Instruction to develop curriculum standards for courses that incorporate a service learning component in order to satisfy the requirements of this bill. The bill would require the Superintendent to consult with leaders of community organizations, pupils, parents, classroom teachers, school administrators, postsecondary educators, representatives of business and industry, and other persons with knowledge or experience the Superintendent deems appropriate to the task of developing these curriculum standards. The bill would require the Superintendent to submit these proposed curriculum standards to the State Board of Education on or before March 1, 2018, and for the state board to adopt or reject curriculum standards that incorporate a service learning component into courses on or before July 1, 2018.
If the state board adopts these proposed curriculum standards, the bill would require the curriculum standards to be implemented by school districts, commencing with the 2018–19 school year, as a component of courses in order to satisfy the graduation requirements enacted by this bill. To the extent the implementation of these curriculum standards would impose new duties on school districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

By changing the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also make it a misdemeanor for a person convicted of violating this provision to own a firearm within 10 years of the conviction. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

This bill would require, instead, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a partnership and a limited liability company classified as a partnership to file a return on the 15th day of the 3rd month, and a taxpayer subject to the Corporation Tax Law, but not an “S corporation,” to file a return on the 15th day of the 4th month, following the close of its taxable year. These tax return due dates would conform to federal income tax return due dates for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.","(Sec. 2) Requires every partnership, on or before the 15th day of the third month following the close of its taxable year, to make a return for that taxable year, specifically the items of gross income and deductions allowed by Part S of the partnership return. Excepts S corporations from this requirement if both of the following occur: (1) the corporation has filed a return, but the shareholder's treatment of the item on the shareholder's return is, or may be, inconsistent with the treatment of the item on the corporate return; (2) the corporation has not filed a return; or (3) the shareholder files with the Franchise Tax Board a statement identifying the inconsistency. Requires that the due date for the short period return be the same as the due date of the federal tax return that includes the net income of the taxpayer for that short period, or if no federal return is required to be filed that would include the net income for that short period."
"Existing law requires the governing boards of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions, in order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, to adopt detailed and victim-centered policies and protocols regarding sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving a student that comport with best practices and current professional standards, covering specified topics, including a comprehensive, trauma-informed training program for campus officials involved in investigating and adjudicating sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking cases.
This bill would, commencing January 1, 2018, require those institutions, in order to receive state funds for student financial assistance, to conduct annual training of their respective employees, in addition to the training described above, on the employee’s obligations in responding to and reporting incidents of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving students. The bill would provide that an employee trained pursuant to these provisions is deemed to have satisfied the annual training requirement for each campus or community college district, as applicable, within each segment that the employee is employed at for that year.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Education Code, with respect to student financial assistance, to require the governing boards of each community college district, the Trustees of the California State University, the Regents of the University of California, and the governing boards of independent postsecondary institutions in California to adopt a policy concerning sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking involving a student, both on and off campus. The policy shall include: an affirmative consent standard in the determination of whether consent was given by both parties; a policy that the standard used in determining whether the elements of the complaint against the accused have been demonstrated as preponderance of the evidence; a policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in the disciplinary process, it shall not be a valid excuse to alleged lack of affirmative consent that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the sexual activity under either of specified circumstances; a policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in any disciplinary process, it shall not be a valid excuse to alleged lack of affirmative consent that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the sexual activity under any of specified circumstances; and a policy that, in the evaluation of complaints in the disciplinary process, it shall not be a valid excuse to alleged lack of affirmative consent that the accused believed that the complainant consented"
"The Franchise Investment Law generally requires a franchisor to register with the Department of Business Oversight before an offer or sale of a franchise in this state and provides that a willful violation of this law is a crime.

Existing law requires the Office of Emergency Services, in cooperation with the State Department of Education, the Department of General Services, and the Alfred E. Alquist Seismic Safety Commission, to develop an educational pamphlet for use by school personnel to identify and mitigate the risks posed by nonstructural earthquake hazards.
This bill would require each school district, county office of education, and charter school, on or before January 1, 2020, to complete an inspection of the contents in areas that are accessible to or occupied by pupils in each of its school buildings located in an area of higher seismicity, as defined, to assess whether the contents in each area comply with the guidelines set forth in the pamphlet and to develop corrective actions to bring noncompliant contents into compliance with the published guidelines. The bill would require, within 60 days of completing the inspection for each area within a school building, that a checklist of compliant and noncompliant contents be reported to the governing board of the school district, the county board of education, or the governing body of the charter school, as applicable, with a prioritization of noncompliant items that threaten the safety of pupils and school personnel and a set of recommended corrective actions to bring high-priority noncompliant contents into compliance with the published guidelines.

The bill would require the commissioner, in evaluating a petition, to take into consideration other violations that present a credible risk to the members of the public since the posting of discipline requested for removal, as specified. Because the fees collected pursuant to these provisions would be deposited in the Real Estate Fund, which is continuously appropriated, the bill would make an appropriation.

Existing law requires that each differing label, other than weight or package size, as described, for specialty fertilizer, packaged agricultural mineral, auxiliary soil and plant substance, organic input material, and packaged soil amendment be registered, and requires that all registrations be renewed in January of an even-numbered year, and be valid until December 31 of the following odd-numbered year, if issued in January of that same year.
This bill would delete those provisions regarding the date for renewal of those registrations and would instead authorize the Department of Food and Agriculture to develop a schedule for all registration to be submitted to the department for approval and would require that registrations be valid for 2 years.

Existing law requires all inspection records obtained by the 3rd-party organization to be made available to the secretary upon request.
This bill would eliminate the requirement that organic input material manufacturers be inspected at least once per year, and would delete the limitation that the secretary is authorized to perform site inspections of organic input material manufacturing processes only during the registration process.

Existing law requires the arrested individual to be informed that a refusal to submit to, or failure to complete, the required chemical testing may be used against the person in court and that the court, upon convicting the arrested individual, may impose increased penalties for his or her refusal or failure.
This bill would instead require the arrested individual to be advised that a criminal complaint may be filed against him or her for operating a vessel or water-related device while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or both; that he or she has a right to refuse chemical testing; and that the officer has the authority to seek a search warrant compelling him or her to submit a blood sample. By imposing new duties on local peace officers, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Harbors and Navigation Code to authorize peace officers who lawfully arrest persons for operating a mechanically propelled vessel or any water- manipulating device under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug, to request that such persons submit to chemical testing of their blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the drug or alcoholic content of the blood. <n>Provides that a person who chooses to submit to a blood or urine test may also be requested to submit to a blood or urine test if the arresting officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person was operating a mechanically propelled vessel or manipulating any water- manipulating device under the influence of any drug, or the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug.

"Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. The Public Utilities Act requires the commission to review and accept, modify, or reject a procurement plan for each electrical corporation based on whether it includes specified elements or incentive mechanisms, and whether it accomplishes certain objectives. The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program, within the act, requires retail sellers, defined as including electrical corporations, and local publicly owned electric utilities to purchase specified minimum quantities of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, for specified compliance periods. The program requires the commission to direct each electrical corporation to annually prepare a renewable energy procurement plan to satisfy its procurement requirements pursuant to the program. To the extent feasible, the renewable energy procurement plan is to be proposed, reviewed, and adopted as part of, and pursuant to, the general procurement plan process.
This bill would make a nonsubstantive revision to the provision that requires, to the extent feasible, that the renewable energy procurement plan be proposed, reviewed, and adopted as part of, and pursuant to, the general procurement plan process.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on June 17, 2011. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

"(1) Existing law establishes the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, independent institutions of higher education, and private postsecondary educational institutions as the segments of postsecondary education in this state.
Existing law states the intent of the Legislature that budget and policy decisions regarding postsecondary education generally adhere to 3 specified goals and that appropriate metrics be identified, defined, and formally adopted to monitor progress toward the achievement of the goals.
Existing law establishes the California Postsecondary Education Commission (CPEC) as the statewide postsecondary education coordinating and planning agency, and provides for its functions and responsibilities. Existing law also provides for the composition of CPEC’s membership. The annual state Budget Acts from the 2011–12 fiscal year to the 2015–16 fiscal year, inclusive, have provided no funding for CPEC.
This bill would establish the Office of Higher Education Performance and Accountability as the statewide postsecondary education coordination and planning entity. The bill would provide for the appointment by the Governor, subject to confirmation by a majority of the membership of the Senate, of an executive director of the office. The bill would establish an 8-member advisory board for the purpose of examining, and making recommendations to, the office regarding the functions and operations of the office and reviewing and commenting on any recommendations made by the office to the Governor and the Legislature, among other specified duties.
The bill would specify the functions and responsibilities of the office, which would include, among other things, participation, as specified, in the identification and periodic revision of state goals and priorities for higher education, reviewing and making recommendations regarding cross-segmental and interagency initiatives and programs, advising the Legislature and the Governor regarding the need for, and the location of, new institutions and campuses of public higher education, acting as a clearinghouse for postsecondary education information and as a primary source of information for the Legislature, the Governor, and other agencies, and reviewing all proposals for changes in eligibility pools for admission to public institutions and segments of postsecondary education.
The bill would authorize the office to require the governing boards and institutions of public postsecondary education to submit data to the office on plans and programs, costs, selection and retention of students, enrollments, plant capacities, and other matters pertinent to effective planning, policy development, and articulation and coordination. To the extent that this provision would impose new duties on community college districts, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require the office to report to the Legislature and the Governor on or before December 31 of each year regarding its progress in achieving specified objectives and responsibilities.
The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2021.
(2)  The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
Existing law establishes the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, and the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as the 3 public segments of postsecondary education in this state.
This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to create the Office of Higher Education Performance and Accountability as the statewide postsecondary education coordination and planning entity.","Requires the office to: (1) inform the identification and periodic revision of state goals and priorities for higher education in a manner that is consistent with the goals outlined in this Act and takes into consideration the metrics outlined in this Act; (2) review and make recommendations regarding cross-segmental and interagency initiatives and programs in areas that may include, but are not necessarily limited to, efficiencies in instructional delivery, financial aid, transfer, and workforce delivery; (3) advise the Legislature and the Governor regarding the need for, and the location of, new institutions and campuses of public higher education; (4) review proposals by the public segments for new programs, the priorities that guide the public segments, and the degree of coordination between those segments and nearby public, independent, and private postsecondary educational institutions; and (5) act as a clearinghouse for postsecondary education information and as a primary source of information for the Legislature, the Governor, and other agencies. Requires the office to develop and maintain a comprehensive database that: (1) ensures the comparability of data from diverse sources; (2) supports studies of individual students as they progress through the state's postsecondary education segments; and (3) provides timely, evaluated information on the condition of higher education in California."
"(1) Existing law establishes the Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Foster Care (AFDC-FC) program, under which counties provide payments to foster care providers on behalf of qualified children in foster care. Existing law establishes a schedule of basic rates to be paid for the care and supervision of each foster child. Existing law also establishes the Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payment Program (Kin-GAP), which provides aid on behalf of eligible children who are placed in the home of a relative caretaker.
Existing law requires, when a child is living with a parent who receives AFDC-FC or Kin-GAP benefits, that the rate paid to the foster care provider on behalf of the parent include an additional amount, known as an infant supplement, for the care and supervision of the child.
This bill would make a pregnant minor or nonminor dependent eligible for the infant supplement for a specified period before the expected date of birth, subject to a verification of pregnancy, as specified. Because counties would administer these extended benefits, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) This bill would incorporate changes to Section 11465 of the Welfare and Institutions Code proposed by both this bill and AB 1997, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to revise the payment rate for care and supervision of children receiving assistance under part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) of title XI of the Social Security Act (SSA) through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) set a uniform rate for each category of eligible licensed community care facilities; and (2) adjust such rate for cost of living after July 1, 1998, and annually thereafter. <n>(Sec. 3) Provides that, notwithstanding specified subdivisions, the payment made for care and supervision of a child who is living with a teen parent in a whole family foster home shall equal the basic rate for children placed in a licensed or approved home. <n>Requires the caregiver to provide the county child welfare agency or probation department with a copy of the shared responsibility plan developed pursuant to SSA title XVII (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) and advise the county child welfare agency or probation department of any subsequent changes to such plan. <n>Requires that a nonminor dependent parent residing in a supervised independent living placement who develops a written parenting support plan pursuant to such title be provided the county child welfare agency or probation department with a copy of such plan and advise the county child welfare agency or probation department of any subsequent changes to such plan."
"(1) The California Emergency Services Act sets forth the duties of the Office of Emergency Services with respect to specified emergency preparedness, mitigation, and response activities within the state. Existing law establishes the Department of Technology under the supervision of the Director of Technology who is also known as the State Chief Information Officer, and generally requires the Department of Technology to be responsible for the approval and oversight of information technology projects by, among other things, consulting with state agencies during initial project planning to ensure that project proposals are based on well-defined programmatic needs. Existing law establishes the Office of Information Security, within the Department of Technology, under the direction of a chief who reports to the Director of Technology.
This bill would require the Department of Technology, in consultation with the Office of Emergency Services and compliance with the information security program required to be established by the chief of the Office of Information Security, to update the Technology Recovery Plan element of the State Administrative Manual to ensure the inclusion of cybersecurity strategy incident response standards for each state agency to secure its critical infrastructure controls and critical infrastructure information. The bill would require each state agency to provide its updated Technology Recovery Plan and report on its compliance with these updated standards to the department, as specified, and authorize the department, in consultation with the Office of Emergency Services, to provide suggestions for a state agency to improve compliance with these standards. The bill would define terms for its purposes and make legislative findings in support of its provisions. The bill would prohibit public disclosure of reports and public records relating to the cybersecurity strategies of state agencies, as specified.
(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.",This bill requires the Department of Technology to update cybersecurity standards and a state technology recovery plan to ensure the inclusion of a cybersecurity strategy for critical infrastructure controls and critical infrastructure information.
"Existing law imposes a maximum civil penalty of $25,000 on a person who discharges various pollutants or other designated materials into the waters of the state.
This bill would impose an additional civil penalty of not more than $10 for each gallon or pound of material discharged. The bill would require that the civil penalty be reduced for every gallon or pound of the illegally discharged material that is recovered and properly disposed of by the responsible party.
The Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act establishes various civil penalties for conduct in connection with the intentional or negligent discharging of oil into waters of the state. Existing law requires civil and criminal penalties provided in the act to be separate from, and in addition to, and to not supersede or limit, any and all other remedies, civil or criminal.
This bill would prohibit a person from being subject to both a civil penalty described above and a civil penalty imposed pursuant to the Lempert-Keene-Seastrand Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act for the same act or failure to act.","This bill amends the Fish and Game Code, with respect to civil and criminal penalties, to require the amount of each civil penalty imposed to be separate and not to exceed 25 thousand dollars ($25,000) for each violation. In determining the amount of each civil penalty, the court must consider the degree of toxicity and volume of the discharge, the extent of harm caused by the violation, whether the effects of the violation may be reversed or mitigated, and with respect to the defendant, the ability to pay, the effect of any civil penalty on the ability to continue in business, any voluntary cleanup efforts undertaken, any prior history of violations, the gravity of the behavior, the economic benefit, if any, resulting from the violation, and any other matters the court determines justice may require. Every civil action brought by the Attorney General, or by the district attorney or city attorney in the name of the people of California, may be joined or consolidated. The court shall: (1) determine whether to issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction without requiring the defendant to prove that it will suffer grave or irreparable harm; and (2) tailor a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction narrowly to address the violation in a manner that will otherwise allow the defendant to continue business operations in"
"Existing law prohibits an employer, whether a public agency or private individual or corporation, from asking an applicant for employment to disclose, or from utilizing as a factor in determining any condition of employment, information concerning an arrest or detention that did not result in a conviction, or information concerning a referral or participation in, any pretrial or posttrial diversion program, except as specified. Existing law also prohibits an employer, as specified, from asking an applicant to disclose, or from utilizing as a factor in determining any condition of employment, information concerning a conviction that has been judicially dismissed or ordered sealed, except in specified circumstances. Existing law specifies that these provisions do not prohibit an employer at a health facility, as defined, from asking an applicant for a specific type of employment about arrests for certain crimes. Existing law makes it a crime to intentionally violate these provisions.
This bill would also prohibit an employer from asking an applicant for employment to disclose, or from utilizing as a factor in determining any condition of employment, information concerning or related to an arrest, detention, processing, diversion, supervision, adjudication, or court disposition that occurred while the person was subject to the process and jurisdiction of juvenile court law. The bill, for the purposes of the prohibitions and exceptions described above, would provide that “conviction” excludes an adjudication by a juvenile court or any other court order or action taken with respect to a person who is under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court law, and would make related and conforming changes. The bill would prohibit an employer at a health facility from inquiring into specific events that occurred while the applicant was subject to juvenile court law, with a certain exception, and from inquiring into information concerning or related to an applicant’s juvenile offense history that has been sealed by the juvenile court. The bill would require an employer at a health facility seeking disclosure of juvenile offense history under that exception to provide the applicant with a list describing offenses for which disclosure is sought.
Because this bill would modify the scope of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Labor Code of California to prohibit: (1) a public agency or private individual or corporation from asking an applicant for employment to disclose information concerning an arrest or detention that did not result in conviction or information concerning a referral to, and participation in, any pretrial or posttrial diversion program or concerning a conviction that has been judicially dismissed or ordered sealed; and (2) a public agency or private individual or corporation from asking an applicant for employment to disclose information concerning an arrest, detention, processing, diversion, supervision, adjudication, or court disposition that occurred while the person was subject to the process and jurisdiction of juvenile court law."
"Existing law prohibits the taking or possession of any fully protected fish, except as provided, and designates the rough sculpin as a fully protected fish. The California Endangered Species Act prohibits the taking of an endangered or threatened species, except as specified. The Department of Fish and Wildlife may authorize the take of listed species if the take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and the impacts are minimized and fully mitigated.
This bill would permit the department to authorize, under the California Endangered Species Act, the take of the rough sculpin (Cottus asperrimus) resulting from impacts attributable to replacing the Spring Creek Bridge in the County of Shasta if certain conditions are satisfied.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code, proposed by AB 2001 and AB 2488, that would become operative only if this bill and either or both of those bills are chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on September 19, 2011.

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Fish and Game Code to revise prohibitions on the taking or possession of fully protected species, except those listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. No provision of the code or any other law shall be construed to authorize the issuance of a permit or license to take a fully protected fish, and no permit or license previously issued shall have force or effect for that purpose. However, the department shall make an effort to notify all affected and interested parties to solicit information and comments on the proposed authorization. The notification shall be published in the California Regulatory Notice Register and be made"
"The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law, including certain credits that are allowed in modified conformity to credits allowed by federal income tax laws. Federal income tax laws allow a refundable earned income tax credit for certain low-income individuals who have earned income and who meet certain other requirements.
The Personal Income Tax Law, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, allows an earned income credit against personal income tax, and a payment in excess of that credit amount, to an eligible individual that is equal to that portion of the earned income tax credit allowed by federal law as determined by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor as set forth in the annual Budget Act.
Existing law, the Earned Income Tax Credit Information Act, requires an employer, as defined, to notify all employees that they may be eligible for the federal earned income tax credit, as specified.
This bill would require those same employers currently required to notify employees who may be eligible for the federal earned income tax credit to also notify these employees that they may be eligible for the California Earned Income Tax Credit under the same conditions.",This bill amends the Revenue and Taxation Act to require employers in California to notify their employees that they may be eligible for the federal earned income tax credit (EITC) and the California EITC. State departments and agencies that serve those who may qualify for the EITC must notify their program recipients that they may be eligible for the EITC.
"Existing law establishes the “Sexual Assault Victims’ DNA Bill of Rights,” which, among other things, encourages a law enforcement agency assigned to investigate specified sexual assault offenses to perform DNA testing of rape kit evidence or other crime scene evidence in a timely manner to assure the longest possible statute of limitations. Existing law also requires a law enforcement agency to inform victims of certain unsolved sexual assault offenses if the law enforcement agency elects not to analyze DNA evidence within certain time limits.
This bill would require law enforcement agencies to report information regarding rape kit evidence to the department through a database established by the department. The bill would require that information to include, among other things, the number of kits collected, the number of kits from which one or more biological evidence samples were submitted to a DNA laboratory for analysis, and the number of kits from which a probative DNA profile was generated. The bill would additionally require a public DNA laboratory, or a law enforcement agency contracting with a private laboratory, to provide a reason for not testing a sample every 120 days the sample is untested, except as specified. By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
This bill would require the department to file a report to the Legislature on an annual basis summarizing the information in its database. The bill would prohibit law enforcement agencies or laboratories from being compelled to provide any contents of the database in a civil or criminal case, except as required by a law enforcement agency’s duty to produce exculpatory evidence to a defendant in a criminal case.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill requires California law enforcement agencies to report to the Department of Justice's Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Tracking database certain data on sexual assault evidence kits, including the number of kits from which one or more biological evidence samples were submitted to a DNA laboratory for analysis, the number of kits from which a probative DNA profile was generated, and the reason or reasons for not submitting evidence from a given rape kit to a DNA laboratory for processing. After 120 days following submission of rape kit biological evidence for processing, if a public DNA laboratory has not conducted DNA testing, that laboratory shall provide reasons for the status in the appropriate SAFET data field. If the investigating law enforcement agency has contracted with a private laboratory to conduct DNA testing on rape kit evidence, the submitting agency shall provide the reasons for the status in the appropriate SAFET data field. Upon expiration of a sexual assault case-related limitation set forth in the state's criminal code, or if a law enforcement agency elects not to analyze the DNA or intends to destroy or dispose of the crime scene evidence, the agency shall state in writing the reason the kit collected as part of that investigation was not analyzed. The bill prohibits the SAFE-T database from containing any identifying information about a victim or a suspect,"
"(1) The existing California Civil Liberties Public Education Act has been enacted for the stated purpose of sponsoring public educational activities and development of educational materials to ensure that the events surrounding the exclusion, forced removal, and internment of persons of Japanese ancestry will be remembered and so that the causes and circumstances of this and similar events may be illuminated and understood.
Existing law requires, to the extent that federal financial analysis methodology incorporates this exemption, income received as reparation payments paid pursuant to federal law for the purpose of redressing the injustice done to persons of Japanese ancestry who were interned during World War II not be considered in determining an applicant’s financial need for purposes of student financial aid programs.
This bill would delete the term “resident aliens” from these provisions and replace it with the term “permanent residents.”
(2) Existing law expresses findings of the Legislature with respect to the impact of the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 on illegal aliens. Existing law also states the intent of the Legislature to establish a state test that may be used by eligible aliens to attest to their understanding of English and understanding of the history and government of the United States to meet the requirements of that act. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction, in consultation with the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, to develop the state test referenced above.
This bill would delete the word “illegal” from the legislative findings relating to these aliens.
(3) This bill would also replace the word “alien” with the term “foreign national” in various provisions relating to educational services provided to immigrants, relating to adult education, and relating to the determination of residence for students of specified public postsecondary educational institutions, but this replacement would be operative only if the Superintendent certifies, in writing, to the Secretary of State of California on or before January 20, 2017, that this terminology has been changed in federal law as specified.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on January 8, 2003.

"Existing law establishes procedures by which a person may claim a refund for an overpayment of the taxes, fees, and surcharges imposed by the Sales and Use Tax Law, the Use Fuel Tax Law, the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law, the Alcoholic Beverage Tax Law, the Energy Resources Surcharge Law, the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge Act, the Hazardous Substances Tax Law, the Integrated Waste Management Fee Law, the Oil Spill Response, Prevention, and Administration Fees Law, the Underground Storage Tank Maintenance Fee Law, and the Diesel Fuel Tax Law, and of taxes, fees, and surcharges imposed in accordance with the Fee Collection Procedures Law. Existing law generally requires that a claim be filed within 3 years after specified periods in which the overpayment was made.
This bill would, with respect to each of the above-described laws, provide that a claim that is otherwise valid that is made in the case in which the amount of tax determined, as defined, has not been paid in full is deemed a timely filed claim for refund with respect to all subsequent payments applied to that determination.

"(1) The Collateral Recovery Act provides for the licensure and regulation of repossession agencies by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services under the supervision and control of the Director of Consumer Affairs. That act defines the term “repossession” as meaning the locating or recovering of collateral by means of an assignment. That act defines the term “assignment” as any written authorization by the legal owner, lienholder, lessor, lessee, registered owner, or the agent of any of them, to repossess any collateral or any written authorization by an employer to recover any collateral entrusted to an employee or former employee in possession of the collateral. That act provides for the issuance of qualification certificates, required for the management of the places of business of licensed repossession agencies, to applicants who meet certain requirements, including, among others, 2 years of lawful experience in recovering collateral and provides that lawful experience does not include employment performing work other than skip tracing, debt collection, or actual collateral recovery. That act makes a violation of any of its provisions a crime.
This bill would remove debt collection from the employment included under lawful experience. The bill would change the definition of assignment to also include any written authorization to skip trace or locate, would define the term “repossession order” as having the same meaning as “assignment,” and would make conforming changes. The bill would delete the definition for the term “repossession.” By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Under the Collateral Recovery Act, licensed repossession agencies are not liable for specified acts or omissions of a legal owner, debtor, lienholder, lessor, lessee, registered owner, or agent of any of them, and are entitled to indemnity from the legal owner, debtor, lienholder, lessor, lessee, or registered owner for losses incurred as a result of those acts or omissions. Under the act, those persons or their agents are not liable for acts or omissions by a licensed repossession agency or its agent in carrying out a repossession order and are entitled to indemnity from the licensed repossession agency for losses incurred as a result of those acts or omissions, as specified.
This bill would extend the above-described provisions applicable to a legal owner, debtor, lienholder, lessor, lessee, or registered owner to a debt collector.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2010.

(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to require that a copy of a repossession order or an assignment or repossession order have the same force and effect as an original written assignment or repossession order, unless it includes a text message, email, or Internet posting. The bill also specifies the terms and conditions relating to such order or assignment."
"Existing law generally requires local agencies to provide each newly hired police officer and deputy sheriff with a pistol and other specified equipment.
This bill would require the Board of State and Community Corrections to develop a grant program to make funds available to local law enforcement entities to purchase body-worn cameras and related data storage and equipment, and to hire personnel necessary to operate a local body-worn camera program. The bill would create the Body-worn Camera Fund, that would continuously appropriate funds to the board for those purposes.
Existing law creates the State Penalty Fund into which moneys collected by the courts from the imposition of fines, forfeitures, or penalties on criminal offenses are deposited. Once a month, certain percentages of money in that fund are transferred into other funds, including, among others, the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund.
This bill would delete the transfer requirement for the Driver Training Penalty Assessment Fund and instead require a transfer to the Body-worn Camera Fund.
By transferring general fund moneys into a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation.
Existing law makes it a felony for an unauthorized person, as defined, to possess, or use, or to obliterate or destroy the brand registration upon, containers, including milk cases, cabinets, or other dairy equipment, which have a value in excess of $950.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to this provision.","Amends the Penal Code to increase California penalties for all criminal offenses, except parking offenses, where multiple offenses are involved and where a court appearance is not mandatory.

"Existing law states that the Legislature finds and declares that sudden infant death syndrome, as defined, is the leading cause of death for children under age one. Existing law requires the coroner to, among other things, perform an autopsy, within 24 hours or as soon thereafter as feasible, in any case where an infant has died suddenly and unexpectedly.
This bill would define “sudden unexplained death in childhood” as the sudden death of a child one year of age or older but under 18 years of age that is unexplained by the history of the child and for which a thorough postmortem examination fails to demonstrate an adequate cause of death. The bill would require the coroner to notify the parent or responsible adult of a child within that definition about the importance of taking tissue samples. The bill would also exempt the coroner from liability for damages in a civil action for any act or omission done in compliance with these provisions. The bill would make other, nonsubstantive, changes.
By expanding the duties of a local agency, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 27491.41 of the Government Code, proposed by SB 1189, to be operative only if SB 1189 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

Brown Act, which generally requires that the meetings of the governing boards of local agencies be open to the public with proper notice given, permit the recording of those meetings, prohibit legislative bodies from taking action by secret ballot and set forth other specific requirements for the conduct of those meetings. Existing law exempts the meetings of specified schoolsite councils and committees from the Ralph M.

This bill would require the director to develop, tailor, and subsequently review and revise baseline security controls for the state based on
emerging industry standards and
baseline security controls published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The bill would require state agencies to comply with, and prohibit state agencies from tailoring their individual baseline security controls to fall below, the state baseline security controls.

Existing law establishes the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund as a special fund, and continuously appropriates moneys in the fund for the administration and enforcement of, among other things, laws regulating the marketing of milk and other dairy products and the stabilization and marketing of market milk.
This bill would, for purposes of those provisions, define the term “educational and research activities” and would additionally provide for the regulation of milk and dairy products-related educational and research activities. The bill would authorize the use of moneys from the above-described assessments and fees for administering and enforcing the manufacturing milk and market milk laws, including the regulation of those educational and research activities.

The bill would authorize a property owner to appeal a fine to the committee. The bill would require these fines to be deposited in the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Fund and would authorize the committee to record a property lien if the fine has not been paid within a specified period of time. By depositing these fines into the Housing Rehabilitation Loan Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, the bill would make an appropriation.","Amends the Health and Safety Code to designate the State of California as a state housing credit agency, requiring it to allocate the state housing credit ceiling in accordance with federal law and to undertake all responsibilities of housing credit agencies, including entering into regulatory agreements relating to projects granted awards. <n>Requires the committee to develop and provide application forms for use by housing credit applicants, including uniform procedures for submission of applications, fees and amounts, and conditions of agreements or other financial agreements to defray the criteria and costs in administering this Act. <n>Authorizes the committee to: (1) reserve a portion of the state's anticipated housing credit ceiling for a subsequent year for a housing credit applicant; and (2) require a housing credit applicant receiving an allocation or reservation of the anticipated housing credit ceiling to deposit with the committee an amount of money as a good-faith undertaking, subject to specified conditions. <n>Authorizes the committee to: (1) make any allocation or reservation of the state's housing credit ceiling to a housing credit applicant subject to terms and conditions in furtherance of the purposes of this Act; and (2) condition an allocation or reservation on the execution of a contract between the housing credit applicant and the committee requiring the applicant to comply with all the terms of the Federal Internal Revenue Code,"

The act authorizes an employer of an EMT-I or EMT-II to conduct investigations and take disciplinary action against an EMT-I or EMT-II who is employed by that employer for specified conduct, and authorizes the authority to, among other things, deny, suspend, or revoke any EMT-P license for the same specified conduct. Existing law requires an EMT-P’s employer to report in writing to the local EMS agency and the authority within 30 days of specified disciplinary action being taken with regard to an EMT-P.
This bill would require the authority to develop and adopt guidelines for disciplinary orders, temporary suspensions, and conditions of probation for EMT-P licenseholders. The bill would also integrate and conform the procedures for investigating misconduct of EMT-P licenseholders with those of EMT-I and EMT-II certificate holders, including requiring notification of disciplinary action with regard to an EMT-P to be given to the local EMS agency and the authority within 3 days.
Existing law authorizes the medical director of the local EMS agency to evaluate information that comes to his or her attention that appears to constitute grounds for disciplinary action against an EMT-P and to make a recommendation to the authority for further investigation or discipline.

This bill, when an applicant for approval of a commercial development has entered into an agreement for partnered housing with an affordable housing developer to contribute affordable housing through a joint project or 2 separate projects encompassing affordable housing, would, until January 1, 2022, require a city, county, or city and county to grant to the commercial developer a development bonus, as specified. The bill would define the development bonus to mean incentives mutually agreed upon by the developer and the jurisdiction that may include but are not limited to, specified changes in land use requirements. This bill would also require a city or county to submit to the Department of Housing and Community Development information describing an approved commercial development bonus.

This bill would require a law enforcement agency, department, or entity, if it employs peace officers and uses body-worn cameras for those officers, to develop a body-worn camera policy. The bill would require the policy to allow a peace officer to review his or her body-worn camera video and audio recordings before making a report, giving an internal affairs statement, or before any criminal or civil proceeding.
The bill would also require the policy to prohibit
a peace officer from making a video or audio recording in a health facility or medical office when a patient may be in view of the body-worn camera or when a health care practitioner is providing care to an individual.

Existing law establishes the maximum tuition award amount for each Cal Grant A and B award for new recipient students attending private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions at $9,084 for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 award years and $8,056 for the 2017–18 award year and each award year thereafter. Existing law also establishes these amounts as the maximum tuition award amounts for new recipients attending private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions that are accredited, as specified.
This bill would instead increase the maximum tuition award amount for Cal Grant A and B awards for new recipients at private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions to no less than $10,000 for the 2017–18 award year and each award year thereafter. For these award years, the maximum tuition award amounts would remain at $8,056 for new recipients attending accredited private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions as referred to above.
The bill would impose requirements on private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions to provide specified data to a specified association as a condition for the funding of Cal Grant awards to their students and would require the association to report on that information to the Legislature, the Governor, the Department of Finance, and the Legislative Analyst’s Office.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on June 26, 2015.

The bill also establishes limitations on the maximum Pell Grant and Cal Grant awards that students may receive at private nonprofit educational institutions."
"Existing law prohibits a person from being tried or adjudged to punishment while that person is mentally incompetent. Existing law establishes a process by which a defendant’s mental competency is evaluated, which includes requiring the court to appoint a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist, and any other expert the court may deem appropriate.
This bill would, on or before July 1, 2017, require the State Department of State Hospitals, through the use of a workgroup representing specified groups, to adopt guidelines for education and training standards for a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist to be considered for appointment by the court. The bill would provide that if there is no reasonably available expert who meets the guidelines, the court shall have discretion to appoint an expert who does not meet the guidelines.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2016.

"Existing law establishes the California Homebuyer’s Downpayment Assistance Program, which requires the California Housing Finance Agency to, among other things, administer a program that provides downpayment assistance, including deferred-payment, low-interest, junior mortgage loans to reduce principal and interest payments, that makes financing affordable to first-time low- and moderate-income home buyers, pursuant to specified terms.
This bill would appropriate $10,000,000 from the General Fund to the California Homebuyer’s Downpayment Assistance Program for the purposes of the downpayment assistance program described above. The bill would condition the application of these funds on an additional requirement that the home for which assistance is provided be in a development project that is in a designated infill site, close to public transit, and that is located in a city, county, or city and county that reduces developer or impact fees or reduces or removes regulatory barriers to housing construction for the development project, as specified. As part of this additional requirement, the bill would require a local agency to provide verification of the local agency’s schedule of local fees, charges, and other exactions to the California Housing Finance Agency and would thereby impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would make these moneys available for the general use of the California Housing Finance Agency for the purposes of the California Homebuyer’s Downpayment Assistance Program if specified requirements are met.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(Sec. 1) Increases the maximum amount of downpayment assistance that may be provided to buyers of new homes within specified transit-oriented development specific plan areas in California from three percent of the sale price to five percent of the purchase price or the appraised value of such new homes.

"Existing law requires the county recorder, upon payment of proper fees and taxes, to record any instrument, paper, or notice that is authorized or required to be recorded, provided that the instrument, paper, or notice meets certain standards. Existing law also requires all documents authorized by law to be recorded in the official records of a county to contain specified information.
This bill would require the documents described above that are rerecorded to be executed and acknowledged or verified as new documents, unless otherwise exempted, as specified, presented solely to correct a rerecording sequence, as specified, or presented solely to make a minor correction, as defined, with a corrective affidavit. The bill would require the corrective affidavit to satisfy certain requirements, including a requirement that the corrective affidavit be certified under penalty of perjury. The bill would require each rerecorded instrument, paper, or notice to include a cover sheet and to state the reason for rerecording.
By imposing new duties upon local county officials with respect to the recordation of documents and by expanding the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on March 19, 2010.

"Existing law makes it an offense to drive a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.
Existing law requires the court to impose as a condition of probation for a conviction for a first violation of driving under the influence, in a county where the board of supervisors has approved, and the State Department of Health Care Services has licensed, a driving-under-the-influence program, that the driver successfully complete the program in the driver’s county of residence or employment, as designated by the court. Existing law provides that enrollment and participation in, and completion of, an approved program shall be subsequent to the date of the current violation.
This bill would require a court to impose an alcohol dependence assessment, as specified, as a condition of probation for a person in an 18-month or 30-month driving-under-the-influence program, or for a first offender who had a specified blood alcohol level. The bill would require the entity administering the assessment to advise the person, among other things, that there are medications that can address alcohol dependence, and that the person should consult his or her physician regarding the results of the assessment. The bill would state findings and declarations of the Legislature regarding driving under the influence.
This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would require American Society of Addiction Medicine assessments for certain individuals who are repeat offenders of driving under the influence of alcohol or who were driving under the influence with excessive blood alcohol levels, to determine if the individual needs treatment, and to refer the individual for additional services, as appropriate, including, but not limited to, physician services, counseling, treatment facility services, and medication-assisted treatment for alcohol abuse.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code to require the Department of Motor Vehicles in California to order a person convicted of driving while under the influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug, or under the combined influence of any alcoholic beverage and any drug, to participate in a licensed alcohol and other drug education and counseling program for at least 18 months.

If the probation department recommends such a program, the court may consider placing the defendant in a treatment program. The court may also: (1) refer a person to a probation department if the person also provides services in a privately operated, licensed program or who has any direct interest in a privately operated, licensed program; and (2) obtain from the Department a copy of the persons driving record to determine whether such person is eligible to participate in such program."
"Existing law establishes the California Avocado Commission within the state government, and requires the commission to establish no fewer than 3 districts and no more than 5 districts within the state, each representing approximately the same percentage of avocado production in California. Existing law requires the commission to consist of a specified number of producers who are not handlers, based on the number of districts the commission establishes, 4 handlers who are elected on a statewide basis, one public member, and the Secretary of Food and Agriculture, and requires there to be 2 alternate handler members. Existing law requires a vacancy of a member position on the commission to be filled by the alternate member. Existing law authorizes certain handlers who handle a specified percentage of volume of avocados to appoint one handler member to the commission and the other handlers to nominate and elect the remaining handler members.
This bill would instead require that a vacancy of a member position be filled by a majority vote of the commission. The bill would decrease the number of handlers on the commission to 2 members and the number of alternate handler members to one member. The bill would remove the authorization for specified handlers to appoint a handler member.
Existing law requires producer members and alternate producer members, at the time of the election, to have a financial interest in producing, or causing to be produced, avocados for market within the district in which the producer stands for election. Existing law prohibits a producer who chooses to stand for election in a particular district from standing for election in any other district for a period of 4 years from the date of his or her most recent election to the commission.
This bill would delete this prohibition on the producer. The bill would specify that, for these purposes, a producer or grower would not include a person who has an average annual production of less than 10,000 pounds of avocados in the 3 preceding marketing years. The bill would require that, to be nominated and elected to the commission, a handler or alternate handler handle no less than 1% of the total industry volume of avocados in the preceding marketing year.
Existing law provides that a quorum of the commission is 11 voting members if the commission consists of 3 or 5 districts, and is 10 voting members if the commission consists of 4 districts. Existing law authorizes the commission to recommend to the secretary that the operations of the commission be suspended upon a specified finding of 11 voting members if the commission consists of 3 or 5 districts, or 10 voting members if the commission consists of 4 districts.
This bill would instead provide that a quorum of the commission is 9 voting members if the commission consists of 3 or 4 districts, and is 10 voting members if the commission consists of 5 districts. The bill would make a similar change to the authorization of the commission to recommend suspension of its operations.
Existing law requires the secretary to establish a list of producers in each district and, in establishing the lists, requires handlers to file, within 90 days following receipt of a written request by the secretary, certain information about each producer from whom the handler purchased or handled avocados.
This bill would require handlers to file the information, including the grove location of each producer instead of district numbers, within 60 days.
Existing law, the California Marketing Act of 1937, authorizes the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to issue marketing orders which regulate producer marketing, the processing, distributing, or handling in any manner of any commodity by any and all persons that are engaged in the producer marketing, processing, distributing, or handling of the commodity within this state. The act requires that any marketing order issued pursuant to the act provide for the establishment of an advisory board to assist the secretary in the administration of any marketing order, as prescribed. Existing law also establishes various commissions and councils to advance the interests of the state’s agricultural and seafood industries to provide benefit to the entire industry and all the people of this state.
Existing law, the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act, requires, with specified exceptions, that all meetings of a state body, as defined, be open and public and all persons be permitted to attend any meeting of a state body. Existing law requires a state body subject to the open meeting requirements of the act that conducts a meeting or proceeding by teleconference to post agendas at all teleconference locations and requires each teleconference location to be accessible to the public. The act also requires the state body to provide an opportunity for members of the public to address the state body directly from any teleconference location.
This bill would require that, for a meeting held by teleconference by a marketing order advisory board or an agricultural or seafood industry council or commission, a member of the advisory board, council, or commission participating by teleconference be listed in the minutes of the meeting and would require the member to provide notice of his or her participation by teleconference at least 24 hours before the meeting. The bill would require the advisory board, council, or commission to designate a primary physical meeting location and would require at least one member of the advisory board, council, or commission to be in attendance at the primary physical meeting location. The bill would require the teleconference phone number and other specified information to be included in the agenda and would require the agenda to be open to the public. The bill would require the advisory board, council, or commission to adopt certain teleconferencing guidelines prior to holding a meeting by teleconference.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","This bill amends the Food and Agricultural Code, with respect to California avocados, to require: (1) a member of an advisory board participating by teleconference at least 24 hours before a meeting to be listed in the minutes and to provide notice of his or her participation by teleconference at least 24 hours before the meeting; (2) the advisory board to designate a primary physical meeting location where participants may physically attend the meeting and participate; and (3) the teleconference phone number and, if applicable, the Internet website or other information indicating how the public can access the meeting remotely to be included in the agenda. Prior to holding a meeting by teleconference, the advisory board shall adopt teleconferencing guidelines to address issues that include, but are not limited to, cancellations as a result of technical difficulties, ensuring transparency, and public participation."
"Existing law establishes the Department of Industrial Relations in the Labor and Workforce Development Agency to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners of California, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment. Existing law establishes within the department the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement, which is vested with the general duty of enforcing labor laws, including those relating to wage claims and employer retaliation.
This bill would require every employer subject to its provisions to keep accurate records of specific information regarding employees for 3 years. The bill would require the division to enforce its provisions and would authorize the Labor Commissioner, who is the chief of the division, to adopt any regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the bill.
The bill would require every employer, effective July 1, 2018, to register annually with the Labor Commissioner in accordance with prescribed procedures. The bill would prohibit an employer from conducting any business without registration as required by the bill and would authorize the commissioner to revoke a registration under certain circumstances. The bill would set application and renewal fees for registration.
The bill would require an employer to include specific information in the registration application. The bill would prohibit the division from granting registration under specific circumstances. The bill would require the commissioner to maintain on the department’s Internet Web site a public database of registered property service employers.
The bill would require the division, by January 1, 2019, to establish a biennial in-person sexual violence and harassment prevention training requirement for employees and employers with the assistance of a prescribed advisory committee to be convened by the director. The bill would require employers, as of July 1, 2018, and until the division establishes that training requirement, to provide employees with a pamphlet of the Department of Fair Employment and Housing on sexual harassment.
The bill would establish civil fines for specific violations of its provisions and vest in the commission the exclusive authority to enforce the civil fine provisions. The bill would require the deposit of registration fees and civil fines in the Labor Enforcement and Compliance Fund and would direct that the moneys in the fund from those fees and fines be used only for the reasonable costs of administering the registration of janitorial contractors and the costs and obligations associated with the administration and enforcement of the bill by the division.","This bill amends the Labor Code to require employers of at least one employee and one or more covered workers to register with the Department of Labor Standards Enforcement. The bill defines &quot;covered successor employer&quot; as one who: uses substantially the same equipment, supervisors, and workforce to offer substantially the same services to substantially the same clients as a predecessor employer, unless the employer maintains the same workforce pursuant to specified requirements; has not had any interest in, or connection with, the operation, ownership, management, or control of the predecessor employer during the preceding three years; is an immediate family member of any owner, partner, officer, licensee, or director of the predecessor employer or of any person who had a financial interest in the predecessor employer; and maintains accurate records for three years, showing all employees engaged within the business of the predecessor employer within the preceding work period and the age of each employee."
"Existing law, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases.
Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for specified purposes, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions associated with water use and supply.
The state board is required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020.
This bill would require the State Water Resources Control Board, in coordination with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Department of Water Resources, to develop and implement a grant and low-interest loan program for water projects that result in the net reduction of water-related greenhouse gas emissions.
The bill would continuously appropriate $200,000,000 annually from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to the State Water Resources Control Board to develop and implement the grant and low-interest loan program.",". The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.) (Sec. 2) This bill requires that 35% of the annual proceeds of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) greenhouse gas emission reduction fund be appropriated for transit, affordable housing, and sustainable communities programs in California. That portion of proceeds must be appropriated for specified programs, including: the Transportation Agency for Intercity Rail Capital Program created by Part 2 of the Public Resources Code, five percent of the annual proceeds of the Low Carbon Operations Program created with Part 3 of the Public Resources Code, the Strategic Growth Council for the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program, ten percent of the annual proceeds of the Water Transit System formula fund, five percent of the annual proceeds of the EPA Low Carbon Operations Program created with Part 3 of the Public Resources Code, and Leak detection in water distribution pipelines and associated energy-efficient water pumps. The bill makes funding available to the State Water Resources Control Board, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Utilities Development Commission, and the Department of Energy for a grant and low-interest loan program for water projects that result in net reduction of water-related greenhouse gas emissions."
"Existing law authorizes a court or magistrate to issue a warrant for the search of a place and the seizure of property or things identified in the warrant if there is probable cause to believe that specified grounds exist.
This bill would require service providers to maintain a law enforcement contact process that meets specified criteria and, by July 1, 2017, file a statement with the Attorney General describing that process. The bill would require a service provider to file a statement with the Attorney General describing any material change to its process as soon as practicable after making that change. The bill would require the Attorney General to consolidate the statements received pursuant to these provisions in one discrete record and regularly make that record available to law enforcement agencies. The bill would make the statements confidential and prohibit their disclosure pursuant to any state law. By increasing the duties of local law enforcement agencies to maintain confidential records, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires electronic communication service providers operating in California to maintain a law enforcement contact process that meets specified criteria, including that it: provides a specific contact mechanism for law enforcement personnel; provides continual availability of the process; and provides a method to provide status updates to a requesting law enforcement agency on a request for assistance."
"Existing law prohibits the taking or possession of a fully protected fish, except as provided, and designates the Owens pupfish as a fully protected fish. Under existing law, the Department of Fish and Wildlife is authorized to permit the taking of a fully protected fish for necessary scientific research, including efforts to recover fully protected, threatened, or endangered species.
Existing law, the California State Safe Harbor Agreement Program Act, establishes a program to encourage landowners to manage their lands voluntarily, by means of state safe harbor agreements approved by the Department of Fish and Wildlife, to benefit endangered, threatened, or candidate species without being subject to additional regulatory restrictions as a result of their conservation efforts. The act authorizes the department to authorize specified acts that are otherwise prohibited pursuant to the California Endangered Species Act by entering into a safe harbor agreement. Under existing law, the act remains in effect until January 1, 2020.
This bill would authorize the department to permit the taking of the Owens pupfish in the Owens River watershed if the take is authorized under a safe harbor agreement.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code, proposed by AB 1845 and AB 2488, that would become operative only if this bill and either or both of those bills are chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2016.

This bill would require a commission member to fully disclose in writing 24 hours before a commission hearing any ex parte communication conducted within 7 days of the commission hearing relating to a matter that will be discussed at the hearing, and would prohibit a commission member or an interested person from conducting such an ex parte communication within 24 hours before the commission hearing.
The Political Reform Act of 1974 provides for the regulation of the lobbying industry, including defining the term “lobbyist” and regulating the conduct of lobbyists. Among its provisions, the act prohibits lobbyists from engaging in certain activities, including accepting or agreeing to accept any payment in any way contingent upon the defeat, enactment, or outcome of any proposed legislative or administrative action. Under the act, a lobbyist is, among others, an individual whose principal duties as an employee are to communicate with, among others, any agency official for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative action. For these purposes, “administrative action” is defined as the proposal, drafting, development, consideration, amendment, enactment, or defeat by a state agency of any rule, regulation, or other action in any ratemaking or quasi-legislative proceeding and “agency official” is defined as any member, officer, employee, or consultant of any state agency who participates in any administrative action in other than a ministerial capacity.
This bill would revise the definition of “administrative action” to include, with regard to proceedings before the California Coastal Commission, specified actions relating to the review, approval, and appeal of certain permit actions and coastal plans and programs. The bill would, however, exclude from these provisions relating to lobbyists an employee of a local government agency seeking, within the scope of his or her employment, to influence quasi-judicial decisions of the commission. The bill would also, for purposes of
a quasi-judicial matter
those matters
before the California Coastal Commission, limit the definition of “agency official” to a member of the commission.
Existing law makes a knowing and willful violation of the Political Reform Act of 1974 a misdemeanor and subjects offenders to criminal penalties.
This bill would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding those crimes.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes with a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(Sec. 2) Redefines ""administrative action"" to include: (1) any proposal, drafting, development, consideration, amendment, enactment, or defeat by any state agency of any rule, regulation, or other action in any ratemaking proceeding or any quasi-legislative proceeding, which shall include any proceeding governed by a specified Federal statute; (2) the decision by any state agency to enter into a contract to invest state public retirement system assets on behalf of a state public retirement system; and (3) for purposes of proceedings before the California Coastal Commission, the proposal, drafting, development, consideration, amendment, enactment, or defeat of any rule, regulation, permit action, Federal consistency review, appeal, local coastal program, port master plan, public works plan, long-range development plan, or categorical or other exclusion from coastal development permit requirements. Redefines ""lobbyist"" to include: (1) any individual who receives two thousand dollars ($2,000) or more in economic consideration in a calendar month, other than reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses, or whose principal duties as an employee are to communicate directly or through his or her agents with any elective state official, agency official, or legislative official for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative action; and (2) a placement agent."
"Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires health care service plan contracts and health insurance policies to provide coverage for specified benefits.
This
bill
bill, until January 1, 2019,
would require a health care service plan contract or a health insurance policy issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2017, to include coverage for hearing aids for an enrollee or insured under 18 years of age, as specified.
These provisions would become inoperative if the Department of Managed Health Care and the Department of Insurance receive a notification from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or any other applicable federal agency that these provisions constitute a discriminatory age limitation under federal law and the state is required to defray the costs of requiring a plan contract or policy to include coverage for hearing aids on behalf of enrollees or insureds who are 18 years of age or older pursuant to a specified federal law.
Because a willful violation of these requirements by a health care service plan would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires a health care service plan contract issued, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2017, to include coverage for hearing aids for all enrollees under 18 years of age when medically necessary. Coverage for hearing aids includes an initial assessment, new hearing aids at least every five years, new ear molds, new hearing aids if alterations to existing hearing aids cannot meet the needs of the child, a new hearing aid if the existing one is no longer working, fittings, adjustments, auditory training, and maintenance of the hearing aids."

Existing law provides that a student, other than a nonimmigrant alien, as defined, who has attended high school in California for 3 or more years, who has graduated from a California high school or attained the equivalent thereof, who has registered at or attends an accredited institution of higher education in California not earlier than the fall semester or quarter of the 2001–02 academic year, and who, if he or she is an alien without lawful immigration status, has filed an affidavit, as specified, is exempt from paying nonresident tuition at the California Community Colleges and the California State University.
This bill would, commencing with the 2017–18 academic year, require the California Community Colleges and the California State University, and would request the University of California to designate a Dream Resource Liaison on each of their respective campuses, as specified, to assist students meeting specified requirements, including undocumented students, by streamlining access to all available financial aid and academic opportunities for those students.

"Existing federal law provides for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known in California as CalFresh, formerly the Food Stamp Program, under which supplemental nutrition assistance benefits allocated to the state by the federal government are distributed to eligible individuals by each county. Existing federal law authorizes a resident of a shelter for battered women and children, as defined, who is currently included in a certified household that also contains the abuser, to apply and, if otherwise eligible, receive an additional allotment of benefits as a separate household. Existing federal law requires a county human services agency to provide CalFresh expedited services to certain households.
This bill would, to the extent permitted by federal law, regulations, waivers, and directives, authorize a resident of, or an individual on a waiting list to get into, a shelter for battered women and children who is currently included in a certified household that also contains the abuser, to apply for, and, if otherwise eligible, would provide that the resident or individual is entitled to, expedited services of an additional allotment of CalFresh benefits as a separate household. By imposing additional duties on local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to develop and make available to homeless shelters, among other locations, CalFresh information on expedited services targeted to the homeless population. Existing law requires each county welfare department, upon request, to provide homeless shelters with a supply of CalFresh applications used to request expedited CalFresh services, as specified.
This bill would additionally require the department to develop and make available to domestic violence shelters CalFresh information on expedited services targeted to victims of domestic violence. The bill would also require a county human services agency, upon request, to provide domestic violence shelters with a supply of CalFresh applications used to request expedited CalFresh services, as specified. By imposing additional duties on local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law authorizes counties to participate in the CalFresh Employment and Training program (CalFresh E&T), established by federal law, and requires participating counties to screen CalFresh work registrants to determine whether they will participate in, or be deferred from, CalFresh E&T. Existing law defers from mandatory placement in CalFresh E&T specified individuals, including an individual who is a veteran who has been honorably discharged from the United States Army.
This bill would additionally defer from mandatory placement in CalFresh E&T, an individual who is a victim of domestic violence.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to direct the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop CalFresh information on expedited services targeted to the homeless population, including unaccompanied homeless children and youths. The bill also requires USDA to develop information on expedited services for victims of domestic violence. Upon receipt of a signed CalFresh application from an unaccompanied child or youth under 18 years of age, the county human services agency shall determine his or her eligibility for CalFresh benefits, including by making a determination of whether he or she is eligible to apply as a household of one or if he or she must apply with members of a household with whom he or she is regularly purchasing and preparing foods. If the application of the child or youth is denied, the county human services agency shall provide the child or youth a written notice explaining the reason for the denial.

"Existing law requires junk dealers and recyclers, as defined, to maintain written records of all sales and purchases made in the course of their business, and makes a violation of the recordkeeping requirements a misdemeanor. Existing law prohibits a junk dealer or recycler from providing payment for nonferrous material, as defined, unless the payment is made by cash or check, the check is mailed or the cash or check is provided no earlier than 3 days after the date of sale, and the dealer or recycler obtains a photograph or video of the seller and certain other identifying information, as specified, which is to be retained by the dealer or recycler, as part of the written record of purchases, for a specified period of time. Existing law exempts from the payment by cash or check requirement those sellers of junk or recycling materials who conduct 5 or more separate transactions per month with the junk dealer or recycler, as specified.
This bill
would
would, until January 1, 2020,
exempt from the payment by cash or check requirement those sellers of junk or recycling materials who carry a surety bond of at least $100,000, covering the business entity at large, including all locations, which exclusively covers the cost of loss to the verifiable owner of stolen scrap metal purchased by the junk dealer or recycler and the cost to local law enforcement of investigating the theft. The bill would define the recoverable cost of loss to the verifiable owner of the scrap metal to be specified damages.
The bill would also require the California Research Bureau to provide a report to the Legislature on or before June 1, 2019, on the impact of these provisions on efforts to reduce and eliminate metal theft.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

"Existing law, until January 1, 2021, establishes the Supervised Population Workforce Training Grant Program to be administered, as provided, by the California Workforce Investment Board. Existing law establishes grant program eligibility criteria for counties and provides that eligible uses for grant funds include, but are not limited to, vocational training, stipends for trainees, and apprenticeship opportunities for the supervised population, which include individuals on probation, mandatory supervision, and postrelease community supervision. Existing law requires the board to develop criteria for the selection of grant recipients, but requires the board to give preference to certain grant applications, including an application that proposes participation by one or more nonprofit community-based organizations that serve the supervised population. Existing law requires the board, by January 1, 2018, to submit a report to the Legislature containing specified information, including an evaluation of the effectiveness of the grant program.
This bill would also require the board to give preference to a grant application that proposes participation by one or more employers who have demonstrated interest in employing individuals in the supervised population. The bill would require the board to include in its report to the Legislature whether the program provided training opportunities in areas related to work skills learned while incarcerated. The bill would update references to the California Workforce Investment Board to reflect its new name, the California Workforce Development Board.","Requires the California Workforce Development Board to administer a supervised population workforce training grant program. Defines &quot;supervised population&quot; as persons who are on probation, mandatory supervision, or post-release community supervision and are supervised by, or are under the jurisdiction of, a county. Requires the Board to develop the grant program and implement it in accordance with specified criteria."
"Existing law establishes the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program, under which each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families using a combination of federal, state, and county funds. Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to establish an income reporting threshold for CalWORKs recipients, including CalWORKs assistance units that do not include an eligible adult, and requires a recipient to notify the county, within 10 days, if the recipient’s household income exceeds the reporting threshold. Existing law requires a CalWORKs assistance unit that does not include an eligible adult to also notify the county, within 10 days, of any change in the recipient’s household composition. Under existing law, if the county determines that the recipient is ineligible for CalWORKs or the recipient’s grant amount should be reduced based on an increase in income or a change in household composition, the county is required to discontinue the recipient from CalWORKs or reduce the recipient’s grant, with timely and adequate notice, as specified. Existing law provides that current and future grants may be reduced because of prior overpayments.
This bill would prohibit the county from assessing an overpayment for the month following a change in income for a recipient of CalWORKs, or following a change in household composition for a CalWORKs assistance unit that does not include an eligible adult, if the recipient has reported the change and the county was unable, before the first of the month following the change in income or household composition, to provide 10 days’ notice of the termination or reduction in benefits. By increasing the administrative duties of counties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the State Department of Social Services to issue an all-county letter or similar instruction by July 1, 2017, and adopt regulations by July 1, 2018, as necessary to implement these provisions.
Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Requires counties, at least once per semiannual reporting period, to inform each recipient of all of the following: (1) the amount of the recipient's income reporting threshold; (2) the duty report; and (3) the consequences of failing to report. Requires a recipient to report to the county, orally or in writing, within ten days when any of the following occurs: (1) the monthly household income exceeds the threshold; (2) the household address has changed; or (3) an incidence of an individual fleeing prosecution or custody or confinement, or violating a condition of probation or parole. Specifies how the counties shall redetermine eligibility and the grant amount when a recipient reports income exceeding the reporting threshold."
"Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver’s licenses and state identification cards to applicants who meet specified criteria and provide the department with the required information. Existing law generally requires an applicant for an original driver’s license or state identification card to submit satisfactory proof to the department that the applicant’s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law.
Existing law, the California New Motor Voter Program, requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to electronically provide to the Secretary of State the records of each person who is issued an original or renewal of a driver’s license or state identification card or who provides the department with a change of address, as specified. The person’s motor vehicle records will then constitute a completed affidavit of registration and the person will be registered to vote, unless the person affirmatively declines to become registered to vote during a transaction with the department, among other conditions.
This bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to electronically provide records of a person to the Secretary of State pursuant to this program only if the person has submitted proof that he or she is a citizen of the United States, as specified. This bill would also require that a person affirmatively agree to become registered to vote during a transaction with the department in order for his or her records to constitute a completed affidavit of registration and for the Secretary of State to register him or her to vote.","(Sec. 1) Directs the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to establish a schedule to electronically provide to the Secretary of State certain information for purposes of outreach and education to eligible voters conducted by the Secretary of State, including: (1) information associated with each person who submits an application for a driver's license or identification card or who notifies the DMV of a change of address if the proof that the person is required to submit to prove that his or her presence in the United States is authorized under Federal law also establishes that such person is a U.S. citizen; and (2) language preference, whether the person chooses to become a permanent vote by mail voter, whether the person agrees to become registered to vote during a transaction with the DMV, and whether the applicant has all voter eligibility requirements.

"Existing law requires every service station in this state to display at a conspicuous place on, at, or near the dispensing apparatus, or at or near the point of sale, at least one clearly visible sign showing a list of applicable state and federal fuel taxes per gallon of motor vehicle fuel sold from the dispensing apparatus. A violation of this provision is an infraction.
Existing law establishes the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission in the Natural Resources Agency, and specifies the powers and duties of the commission with respect to energy resources in the state. Under existing law, various provisions regulate petroleum supply and pricing.
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The act authorizes the state board to include the use of market-based compliance mechanisms.
This bill would require every service station to also display the average per-gallon cost of gasoline and diesel fuel, as annually calculated by the
commission,
commission in consultation with the Legislative Analyst’s Office,
across the industry of refiners producing transportation fuels as a result of their compliance with a market-based compliance mechanism. Because a violation of this requirement would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Requires every service station to provide during operating hours to customers who purchase motor vehicle fuel, water, compressed air, and a gauge for measuring air pressure to the public for use in servicing any passenger vehicle, with an unladen weight of 6,000 pounds or less.Requires every service station located within 660 feet of an accessible right-of-way of an interstate or primary highway to provide during business hours public restrooms for use by its customers.Prohibits service stations from charging customers separately for the use of restroom facilities. Requires the public restroom to be temporary or portable but shall be permanent and include separate facilities for men and women, each with toilets and sinks suitable for use by disabled persons."
"Existing law regulates the licensing and operation of talent services within the entertainment industry. Existing law prohibits specific activities or omissions by a talent service or its owners, directors, officers, agents, and employees, including the failure to remove information about, or photographs of, an artist displayed on the talent service’s Internet Web site or an Internet Web site that the service has the authority to design or alter, within 10 days of delivery of a request made by telephone, mail, facsimile transmission, or email from the artist or from a parent or guardian of the artist if the artist is a minor. If the talent service offers to display information about, or a photograph of, an artist on the service’s Internet Web site, existing law requires a contract between an artist and a talent service to contain a notice that the talent service will remove the content within 10 days of a request by the artist or the artist’s parent or guardian, if a minor. A willful violation of those prohibitions is a crime.
This bill would prohibit these specific activities or omissions of a talent service, its owners, directors, officers, agents, and employees through any means of communication. The bill would extend the prohibition of the failure to remove an artist’s information or photographs to those displayed on an online service, online application, or mobile application of the talent service or one that the talent service has the authority to design or alter and would require the talent service to also act on requests to remove information or photographs made by text message or other electronic communication. The bill would expand the above-described notice requirement to contracts in which the talent service offers to display information about, or a photograph of, an artist on the service’s online service, online application, or mobile application. Because a violation of these provisions would be a crime under certain circumstances, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2010.

"Existing law establishes various programs to provide health care coverage to persons with limited financial resources, including the Medi-Cal program and the state’s children’s health insurance program (CHIP). Existing law establishes the California Health Benefit Exchange (Exchange), pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and specifies the duties and powers of the board governing the Exchange relative to determining eligibility for enrollment in the Exchange and arranging for coverage under qualified health plans through the Exchange.
Existing law, the Health Care Reform Eligibility, Enrollment, and Retention Planning Act, requires an individual to have the option to apply for insurance affordability programs in person, by mail, online, by telephone, or by other commonly available electronic means. Existing law defines “insurance affordability programs” to include the Medi-Cal program, CHIP, and a program that makes available to qualified individuals coverage in a qualified health benefit plan through the Exchange with advance payment of the premium tax credit established under a specified provision of the Internal Revenue Code and a cost-sharing reduction under a specified provision of federal law. During the processing of an application, renewal, or a transition due to a change in circumstances, existing law requires an entity making eligibility determinations for an insurance affordability program to ensure that an eligible applicant and recipient of those programs that meets all program eligibility requirements and complies with all necessary requirements for information moves between programs without any breaks in coverage and without being required to provide any forms, documents, or other information or undergo verification that is duplicative or otherwise unnecessary.
This bill would establish procedures to ensure that eligible recipients of insurance affordability programs move between the Medi-Cal program and other insurance affordability programs without any breaks in coverage as required under the provision described above. The bill would require an individual’s case information and eligibility determination to be referred to his or her county of residence within 3 business days if the individual who has been enrolled in a qualified health plan through the Exchange is determined newly eligible for Medi-Cal through the California Healthcare Eligibility, Enrollment and Retention System (CalHEERS). The bill would require those referrals to be processed by the county, as specified, to ensure the individual’s Medi-Cal eligibility is effective pursuant to specified timelines.
The bill would generally prohibit, if an individual is eligible to enroll in a qualified health plan through the Exchange, Medi-Cal benefits from being terminated until at least 20 days after the county sends the notice of action terminating Medi-Cal eligibility, and would require the notice of action to inform the individual of the date by which he or she must select and enroll in a qualified health benefit plan through the Exchange, as specified. The bill would provide that this provision shall only be implemented to the extent that federal financial participation is available.
By modifying the enrollment process under the Medi-Cal program, thereby increasing the responsibilities of counties in the administration of the Medi-Cal program, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code, with respect to the state health benefit exchange program under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act, to require a county to perform redeterminations of Medicaid eligibility for a beneficiary every 12 months and promptly redetermine eligibility whenever it receives information about changes in the beneficiary's circumstances that may affect eligibility for Medicaid benefits. Under current law, a county must redetermine a beneficiary's eligibility for Medicaid unless the reason for the loss of eligibility is one that would result in the need for a redetermination without a concurrent determination of eligibility for cash aid under the CalWORKs program. The bill defines ""redetermination"" as the determination of eligibility on a basis that is exempt from the use of MAGI-based financial methods, including, but not limited to: (1) the county assesses the beneficiary as being potentially eligible under a program that is exempt from the use of MAGI-based financial methods, including on the basis of age, blindness, disability, or the need for long-term care services and supports; or (2) the beneficiary requests that the county determine whether he or she is eligible on a basis that is exempt from the use of MAGI-based financial methods."
"Existing law generally punishes the willful disobedience of the terms of a court order as contempt of court by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding 6 months, a fine not exceeding $1,000, or both that imprisonment and fine. Existing law makes the willful and knowing violation of specified protective orders or stay-away court orders punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine for a first offense, and makes a 2nd or subsequent conviction for a violation of these specified protective orders or stay-away court orders occurring within 7 years of a prior conviction and involving an act of violence or credible threat of violence punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony. If probation is granted upon conviction of a willful and knowing violation of these specified protective orders or stay-away court orders, existing law requires the court to impose a minimum period of probation of 36 months, a criminal protective order protecting the victim from further acts of violence, threats, stalking, sexual abuse, and harassment, a minimum fine of $500, successful completion of a batterer’s program, and a specified amount of appropriate community service, among other requirements.
Under existing law, any person who willfully inflicts corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon a spouse or former spouse, cohabitant or former cohabitant, fiancé or fiancée, or someone with whom the offender has, or previously had, an engagement or dating relationship, or the mother or father of the offender’s child, is guilty of a felony or a misdemeanor. Upon a conviction, existing law allows the sentencing court to issue an order restraining the defendant from any contact with the victim for up to 10 years.
This bill would make a violation of the above protective order issued for the conviction of inflicting a corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding $1,000, or by both that imprisonment and fine. The bill would make a 2nd or subsequent violation occurring within 7 years involving an act of violence or a credible threat of violence punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor. If probation is granted for a violation of these protective orders, this bill would require the court to impose a minimum period of probation of 36 months, a criminal protective order protecting the victim from further acts of violence, threats, stalking, sexual abuse, and harassment, a minimum fine of $500, successful completion of a batterer’s program, and a specified amount of appropriate community service, among other requirements. By increasing the punishment for a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Penal Code to expand the categories of contempt of court to include, among other things: (1) behavior committed during the sitting of a court of justice, in the immediate view and presence of the court and directly tending to interrupt its proceedings or to impair the respect due to its authority; (2) behavior committed in the presence of a referee, while actually engaged in a trial or hearing, pursuant to the order of a court, or in the presence of any jury while actually sitting for the trial of a cause, or upon an inquest or other proceeding authorized by law; (3) a breach of the peace, noise, or other disturbance directly tending to interrupt the proceedings of the court; (4) willful disobedience of the terms as written of any process or court order or out-of-state court order, lawfully issued by a court, including orders pending trial; (5) resistance willfully offered by any person to the lawful order or process of a court; (6) the contumacious and unlawful refusal of a person to be sworn as a witness or, when so sworn, the like refusal to answer a material question; (7) the publication of a false or grossly inaccurate report of the proceedings of a court; (8) presenting to a court having power to pass sentence upon a prisoner under conviction, or to"
"Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. Under existing law, the Director of Managed Health Care may, after appropriate notice and opportunity for a hearing, by order suspend or revoke a license issued under the act or assess administrative penalties if the director determines that the licensee has committed an act or omission constituting grounds for disciplinary action.
This bill would provide that a health care service plan is not required to include abortion as a covered benefit. The bill would prohibit the director from denying a license, or disciplining a licensee, on the basis that the plan excludes coverage for abortions.
Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care. Existing law requires health care service plans and, if applicable, specialized health care service plans, to meet specified criteria, including requiring the appropriate licensure of facilities and personnel. Willful violation of that act a crime.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.",Provides that a health care service plan shall not be required to include abortion as a covered benefit. Requires plans to: (1) be licensed by the State Department of Public Health; (2) employ and utilize allied health manpower; (3) make all services readily available to each enrollee; and (4) have the organizational and administrative capacity to provide services.
"Existing law authorizes a county to establish an interagency child death review team to assist local agencies in identifying and reviewing suspicious child deaths and facilitating communication among persons who perform autopsies and the various persons and agencies involved in child abuse or neglect cases. Existing law requires records that are exempt from disclosure to 3rd parties pursuant to state or federal law to remain exempt from disclosure when they are in the possession of a child death review team.
This bill would authorize the voluntary disclosure of specified information, including mental health records, criminal history information, and child abuse reports, by an individual or agency to an interagency child death review team. The bill would provide that written or oral information disclosed to a child death review team pursuant to these provisions would remain confidential, and would not be subject to disclosure or discovery by a 3rd party unless otherwise required by law.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","Amends the Penal Code to authorize each county to establish an interagency child death review team to assist local agencies in identifying and reviewing suspicious child deaths and facilitating communication among persons who perform autopsies and the various persons and agencies involved in child abuse or neglect cases. <n>Authorizes each county to develop a protocol that may be used as a guideline by persons performing autopsies on children to assist coroners and other persons who perform autopsies in the identification of child abuse or neglect, in the determination of whether child abuse or neglect contributed to death or whether child abuse or neglect had occurred prior to but was not the actual cause of death, and in the proper written reporting procedures for child abuse neglect, including the designation of the cause and mode of death. <n>Instructs each county, working in consultation with local members of the California State Association for Child Abuse Prevention or county child abuse prevention coordinating councils, in developing an interagency child death review team and an autopsy protocol, to solicit suggestions and final comments from persons, including but not limited to: (1) experts in the field of forensic pathology; (2) pediatricians with expertise in child abuse; (3) siblings and medical examiners; (4) district attorneys; (5) child protective services staff; (6) law enforcement personnel; (7) county health department"

collected by the state board as part of a market-based compliance mechanism to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and to be available upon appropriation. Existing law continuously appropriates specified portions of the annual proceeds in the fund to various programs, including 5% for the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program, which provides operating and capital assistance for transit agencies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve mobility, with a priority on serving disadvantaged communities.
This bill would additionally authorize moneys appropriated to the program to be expended to support the operation of existing bus or rail service if the governing board of the requesting transit agency declares a fiscal emergency and other criteria are met, thereby expanding the scope of an existing continuous appropriation.","Creates the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program to provide operating and capital assistance for transit agencies in California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve mobility, with a priority on serving disadvantaged communities."
"Existing law, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, authorizes a beer manufacturer, the holder of a winegrower’s license, a distilled spirits rectifier, a distilled spirits manufacturer, or a distilled spirits manufacturer’s agent to purchase advertising space and time from, or on behalf of, an on-sale retail licensee subject to specified conditions, including that the advertising space or time is purchased only in connection with the events to be held on the premises of the exposition park, stadium, or arena owned by the on-sale licensee. Existing law makes a violation of these provisions a crime.
This bill would change that specified condition to also allow the advertising space or time to be purchased in connection with the events to be held on those premises leased by the on-sale licensee. By changing the definition of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

Existing law authorizes moneys in that fund to be used for specified purposes, including for grants for the support of state and local government agencies impacted by tribal government gaming. Existing law, until January 1, 2021, creates a County Tribal Casino Account in the treasury of each county that contains a tribal casino, which is funded according to specified formulas. Existing law requires the Controller, in consultation with the California Gambling Control Commission, to divide the County Tribal Casino Account for each county that has gaming devices that are subject to an obligation to make contributions to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund into a separate account, known as an Individual Tribal Casino Account, for each tribe that operates a casino within the county. Each Individual Tribal Casino Account is required to be funded in proportion to the amount that each individual tribe paid in the prior fiscal year to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund, and authorizes funds in these accounts to be released to make grants to local agencies impacted by tribal casinos, as specified. Existing law establishes an Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee in each county in which gaming is conducted, specifies the composition and responsibilities of that committee, and requires that committee to make the selection of grants from those casino accounts.

The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
Existing federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, provides for the negotiation and execution of tribal-state gaming compacts for the purpose of authorizing certain types of gaming on Indian lands within a state. The California Constitution authorizes the Governor to negotiate and conclude compacts, subject to ratification by the Legislature. Existing law ratifies a number of tribal-state gaming compacts between the State of California and specified Indian tribes.
This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation related to tribal gaming in California.","Requires the Controller, acting in consultation with the California Gambling Control Commission, to divide the County Tribal Casino Account for each county that has gaming devices that are subject to an obligation to make contributions to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund into a separate account for each tribe that operates a casino within the county.

The bill would also make it unlawful to use an unmanned aircraft system to take, or assist in the take of, fish or wildlife for sport purposes, including, but not limited to, the use of unmanned aircraft systems for scouting purposes. The bill would provide that an unmanned aircraft system is a motorized air vehicle within the meaning of a certain existing prohibition and, thus, under that prohibition may not be used to pursue, drive, or herd any bird or mammal, except as specified, including, among other things, specified permits and notices.
Because violations of the provisions of the bill would be crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would provide that certain of its provisions are severable and do not apply to the operation of an unmanned aircraft system by a state agency within or over these managed lands or waters, or to any person whom the Federal Aviation Administration authorizes to operate an unmanned aircraft system for a commercial purpose and who operates it in a manner that complies with that authorization.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

include food preparation needs within the recurring special needs for which a recipient may receive the $10 monthly allowance. The bill would also
require that an additional allowance be paid each month in the amount of $20 or actual expenses, whichever is greater, to a recipient who has a special, diet-related food need caused by a permanent or temporary medical condition, other than pregnancy.
The bill would require the verification to be signed by a licensed physician, dentist, dietician, nutritionist, or other qualified health practitioner.
The bill would require verification of the recipient’s medical condition by a health care provider, as specified.
By increasing the administrative duties of counties administering the CalWORKs program, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code, with respect to the California Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, to exclude unborn children, or recipients of aid under the program, from the determination of the family's income for purposes of payment of aid.

By June, 30, 2016, the bill would require the Fish and Game Commission to adopt regulations to implement the act, including regulations establishing an oak removal permit application fee. The bill would require the fee to be deposited into the Oak Woodlands Protection Act Fund, as created by the bill. Moneys in the fund would be continuously appropriated to the department for purposes of paying the total costs incurred by the department in administering and enforcing the act, thereby making an appropriation.
The bill would provide that any person who violates the act is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation. The bill would require all civil penalties collected to be apportioned in a specified manner, including 50% to be distributed to the Wildlife Conservation Board for deposit into the Oak Woodlands Conservation Fund.
Existing law requires a county to determine whether a project may result in a conversion of oak woodlands that will have a significant effect on the environment, and if it does, existing law requires the county to require one or more specified oak woodlands mitigation alternatives to mitigate the significant effect.

Existing law also requires, prior to a local law enforcement agency designating, or submitting a document to the Attorney General’s office for the purpose of designating, a person as a gang member, associate, or affiliate in a shared gang database, as defined, the local law enforcement agency to provide written notice to the person and his or her parent or guardian of the designation and the basis for the designation if the person is under 18 years of age, except as specified. Existing law authorizes the person or his or her parent or guardian to submit written documentation contesting that designation and requires the local law enforcement agency to provide written verification of its decision within 60 days.
This bill would require the department, on or before January 1, 2018, to expand its shared gang database, as defined in the provision described above, in order to provide accurate, timely, and electronically generated data of statewide human trafficking intelligence information. The bill would specify that the purpose of that expansion is to allow law enforcement agencies in California to collaborate in reducing the incidence of human trafficking. The bill would authorize the department to promulgate regulations to implement its provisions.","Amends the Penal Code to allow a peace officer to arrest a person in to a warrant, or pursuant to the authority granted to such person by a judicial order, without a warrant when: (1) the officer has probable cause to believe that such person has committed a public offense in the officer's presence; (2) the person has committed a felony, although not in the officer's presence; or (3) the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed a felony, whether or not a felony, in fact.Requires any time a peace officer is called out on a domestic violence call to make a good faith effort to inform the victim of his or her right to make such an arrest, unless the suspect is having an engagement or dating relationship with the victim or has parented a child.Provides that when a peace officer is responding to a call alleging a violation of a domestic violence protective or restraining order or of a domestic violence protective or restraining order issued by the court of another State, tribe, or territory and the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the person against whom the order is issued has notice of the order and has committed an act in violation, the officer shall, consistent with specified requirements, make a lawful arrest of such person without a warrant and take"
"Existing law, the Acupuncture Licensure Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of the practice of acupuncture by the Acupuncture Board, within the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law authorizes the board, with the approval of the Director of Consumer Affairs, to appoint an executive officer who is exempt from civil service. Existing law repeals the provisions establishing the board and authority for it to appoint an executive officer on January 1, 2017.
The bill would extend the operation of the board and the board’s authority to appoint an executive officer until January 1, 2019.
Existing law requires, among other things, the completion of an approved educational and training program in order to be issued a license to practice acupuncture. For purposes of the act, beginning January 1, 2017, existing law defines “approved educational and training program” as a school or college offering education and training in the practice of an acupuncturist who meets various requirements, including offering curriculum that includes specified hours of didactic and laboratory training and supervised clinical instruction. Existing law requires these programs to submit that curriculum to the board and to receive board approval of the curriculum.
This bill would provide that any school or college offering education and training in the practice of acupuncture that was approved by the board prior to January 1, 2017, is deemed to have had its curriculum approved by the board if its approval has not been revoked and it has not changed its curriculum since receiving board approval.
Beginning January 1, 2017, existing law requires the board to establish standards for the approval of educational training and clinical experience received outside the United States.
This bill would repeal that board requirement. The bill would instead require an applicant completing education outside of the United States to submit documentation of his or her education to a board approved credential evaluation service for evaluation and to have the results of the evaluation sent directly from the credential evaluation service to the board. The bill would require the board to examine the received results to determine if an applicant meets requirements for licensure and, if the evaluated education is not sufficient, would authorize the board to offer the applicant additional education, training, or testing, as specified. The bill would require the board to establish, by regulation, an application process, criteria, and procedures for approval of a credential evaluation service. The bill would require the regulations to, at a minimum, require the credential evaluation service to meet specified requirements. The bill would define, for these purposes, an “approved credential evaluation service” as an agency or organization that is approved by the board to evaluate education completed outside the United States and identify the equivalency of that education to education completed within the United States. The bill would also make nonsubstantive changes.","This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to revise requirements for an approved educational and training program offering education and training in the practice of acupuncture. For purposes of this bill, an &quot;approved educational and training program&quot; is a school that: offers curriculum that includes at least 3,000 hours of which at least 2,050 hours are didactic and laboratory training, and at least 950 hours are supervised clinical instruction; has submitted that curriculum to the California Acupuncture Board and has received board approval; has received full institutional approval in the field of traditional Asian medicine, or in the case of institutions located outside of this state, approval by the appropriate governmental educational authority using standards equivalent to those of Article 6 of the Education Code; and has submitted a letter of intent to pursue accreditation to the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Medicine within 30 days of receiving full institutional approval, and is granted candidacy status within three years of such letter. The board shall review, determine whether the curriculum satisfies its requirements, and notify the school or college, the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Medicine, and the Bureau of Private and Postsecondary Education of whether the board has approved the curriculum. The bill repeals requirements that: (1) the board issue a license to practice acupuncture to any person who makes an application and meets certain"
"Existing law provides for the payment of unemployment compensation benefits and extended duration benefits to eligible persons who meet specified requirements. Existing law prohibits the payment of unemployment benefits to educational institution employees of a public entity, as defined, including teachers, researchers, and administrators for the period between 2 academic years when there is a reasonable assurance that the employee will perform his or her regular services in the subsequent academic year, except as specified. Existing law similarly prohibits the payment of unemployment benefits to specified educational institution employees of a public entity other than teachers, researchers, or administrators between 2 academic years, except as specified, but provides a procedure for this 2nd category of educational employees, under certain conditions, to seek payment of retroactive unemployment benefits for the period between 2 academic years. Existing law requires specified notice regarding reasonable assurance of employment in the following academic term be sent to employees before the end of the current academic term.
This bill would delete the prohibition on the payment of unemployment benefits to education employees of a public school, other than teachers, researchers, and administrators, as specified, between 2 academic years. The bill would phase in up to 8 weeks of benefits available to those specified employees over a 4-year timeframe contingent on funds being appropriated for that purpose in the annual Budget Act.
Because this bill would expand the categories of people who could receive benefits from the Unemployment Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, it would make an appropriation.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 2, 2017. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Unemployment Insurance Code to revise the formula for determining extended unemployment compensation benefits for individuals who perform services for an educational institution between two successive academic years. The bill applies to individuals who perform services in the instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity for an educational institution if there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the services in the second of the academic years or terms. However, if the individual was not offered an opportunity to perform the services for the second of the academic years or terms, benefits shall be entitled to each week for which the individual filed a timely claim for benefits and for which benefits were denied solely by reason of this section. Retroactive benefits shall be claimed in accordance with this departments procedures which shall specify that where the individual was entitled to benefits based on services performed for other than an educational institution, an individual who has a reasonable assurance of reemployment may satisfy the search for work requirement of this section by registering for work during the period between the first and second academic years or years. Benefits may be made no later than 30 days following the commencement of the second academic year or term. The bill authorizes benefits for an employee of"
"(1) Existing law provides various circumstances that constitute rape, which are punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 3, 6, or 8 years, except as specified.
Existing law also prescribes circumstances that constitute unlawful sexual intercourse, some of which involve an adult perpetrator who engages in that unlawful intercourse with a minor, as specified. Unlawful sexual intercourse under those circumstances is punishable by imprisonment for 2, 3, or 4 years, and also may be subject to designated civil penalties or fines. Under existing law, any person 21 years of age or older who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is under 16 years of age is guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to a specified provision of law for 2, 3, or 4 years.
This bill would subject any person 21 years of age or older who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is under 16 years of age and is convicted of a felony to a sentence enhancement of 2 years, if the perpetrator holds a position of authority over the minor with whom he or she engaged in the act of unlawful sexual intercourse. By changing the penalty for the commission of unlawful sexual intercourse under the above circumstances, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law makes it a crime for a person to engage in specified acts of a sexual nature with a minor, including lewd and lascivious conduct when the victim is a child of 14 or 15 years of age and the person is at least 10 years older, and sodomy, oral copulation, or sexual penetration of a minor under 16 years of age when the person is 21 years of age or older.
This bill would impose an additional term of 2 years when a person who is convicted of a felony violation of the above crimes is a person who holds a position of authority, as defined, over the minor victim. By increasing the penalty for a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the California Penal Code to define "" unlawful sexual intercourse"" as an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person who is not the spouse of the perpetrator if the person is a minor. Specifies that: (1) any person who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is not more than three years older or three years younger than the perpetrator is guilty of a misdemeanor; (2) any person 21 years or older who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is under 16 years of age is guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony; and (3) a person who is guilty of a felony who holds a position of authority over the minor with whom he or she has engaged in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse shall be punished by an additional term of imprisonment in a county jail for two years. Specifies that a person is in a ""position of authority"" if he or she, by reason of that position, is able to exercise undue influence over a minor. Specifies that civil penalties may be imposed against: (1) adults who engage in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor less than two years younger than the adult; (2) adults who engage in such an act with a minor at least three years younger than"
"Existing law establishes in state government the Government Operations Agency, headed by the Secretary of Government Operations. The secretary is required to review the operations and evaluate the performance of each department, office, or other unit within the agency and seek to continually improve, among other things, the operating policies and the management of information systems of those entities within the agency. The agency includes, among other state government entities, the Department of General Services and the Department of Technology.
This bill would establish, within the Government Operations Agency, the Department of Customer Service to be headed by a Director of Customer Service, who would be appointed by, and serve at the pleasure of, the Governor. The bill would require the director to engage the agency to promote an understanding of customer service and ensure the agency is making administrative decisions that serve customer needs. The bill would further require the director to, among other things, advise the Governor on the strategic development and management of state customer service programs, and consult with the Director of Technology, the Director of General Services, and the Director of Finance to establish customer service goals for state information technology. The bill would specifically require the director to annually report to the Director of Finance and specific committees of the Legislature regarding the cost savings achieved through improvements to customer service within the Government Operations Agency that were implemented by the department, and would further require the director to annually report on the customer service performance of the agency. The bill would require all state entities to reasonably cooperate with the requests of the director that relate to the duties of the director and the department. The bill would make related legislative findings.","Requires the director to: (1) advise the Governor on the strategic development and management of state customer service programs, (2) develop and manage a customer service program within the agency that captures annual and transactional feedback in a unified and standardized platform to improve an understanding of customer service and allows the agency to take action on that data, (3) develop and implement the ideal customer experience for new and existing products and services provided by the agency, (4) develop and manage an employee program within the agency to capture and analyze employee feedback regarding customer service that fosters employee retention, recruitment, engagement, and productivity, (5) develop a mechanism to give customers the opportunity to provide real-time feedback through the Internet, telephone, and in-person communication, (6) create a strong, customer-centric culture complete with accountability and ownership at all levels of the agency, (7) establish performance management and improvement processes to ensure state customer service and state customer service systems are efficient and effective, (8) develop and manage a strategy to improve the delivery of a positive customer service experience across information technology, human resources, and procurement functions of the agency, and (9) consult with the Secretary of Government Operations and the heads of entities within the agency to ensure the integration of customer service initiatives and compliance with information technology policies and standards for the effective management of information technology services"
"(1)The
The
California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 establishes the State Air Resources Board as the state agency responsible for monitoring and regulating sources emitting greenhouse gases. The act requires the state board to adopt regulations to require the reporting and verification of statewide greenhouse gas emissions and to monitor and enforce compliance with this program. The act requires the state board to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit, as defined, to be achieved by 2020 equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990. Existing law requires the state board to complete a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, as defined, in the state.
Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including gas corporations. The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program requires the Public Utilities Commission to establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring all retail sellers, as defined, to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, at specified percentages of the total kilowatthours sold to their retail end-use customers during specified compliance periods.
This bill would require the state board, in coordination with the Public Utilities
Commission and State Energy Resources and Conservation Development
Commission, to
consider and, as appropriate,
adopt a policy
or programs
to increase the production and use of renewable gas, as specified, generated by either an eligible renewable energy resource that meets the requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program or direct solar energy, as specified.
(2)Existing law authorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public utility and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable. Existing law authorizes certain public utilities, including gas corporations, to propose research and development programs and authorizes the commission to allow inclusion of expenses for research and development in the public utility’s rates. Existing law requires the commission to consider specified guidelines in evaluating the research, development, and demonstration programs proposed by gas corporations.
The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program requires the commission to adopt policies and programs that promote the in-state production and distribution of biomethane. Existing law requires the commission to adopt, by rule or order, (1) standards for biomethane that specify the concentrations of constituents of concern that are reasonably necessary to protect public health and ensure pipeline integrity and safety, as specified, and (2) requirements for monitoring, testing, reporting, and recordkeeping, as specified. Existing law requires a gas corporation to comply with those standards and requirements and requires that gas corporation tariffs condition access to common carrier pipelines on the applicable customer meeting those standards and requirements.
This bill would request the California Council on Science and Technology to undertake and complete a study analyzing the regional and gas corporation specific issues relating to minimum heating value and maximum siloxane specifications adopted by the commission for biomethane before it can be injected into common carrier gas pipelines. If the California Council on Science and Technology agrees to undertake and complete the study, the bill would require each gas corporation operating common carrier pipelines in California to proportionately contribute to the expenses to undertake the study with the cost recoverable in rates. The bill would authorize the commission to modify certain available monetary incentives to allocate some of the incentive moneys to pay for the costs of the study so as to not further burden ratepayers with additional expense. If the California Council on Science and Technology agrees to undertake and complete the study, the bill would require the commission, within 6 months of its completion, to reevaluate requirements and standards adopted for injection of biomethane into common carrier pipelines and, if appropriate, change those requirements and standards or adopt new requirements and standards, giving due deference to the conclusions and recommendations made in the study.
(3)Under existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.
Because certain provisions of the bill would be a part of the act and a violation of an order or decision of the commission implementing its requirements would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program by creating a new crime.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Health and Safety Code to define ""biogas"" as gas generated from organic waste, including landfill gas, wastewater treatment, and diverted organic waste. Authorizes the production of biomethane from multiple sources, including landfill, gasification, pyrolysis, or other conversion technology that converts organic matter to gas. States that biomethane: (1) may be produced from multiple sources of agricultural waste, forest waste, gasification, wastewater treatment, and diverted organic waste; and (2) provides a sustainable and clean alternative to fossil fuel emissions, including carbon dioxide equivalent every year. States that it is the policy of the state of California that the policies and programs adopted by the Public Utilities Commission and the California Council on Science and Technology be guided by the best interests of ratepayers. Requires the state board on energy, in adopting the California Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Program, to ensure that eligible renewable gas provides direct benefits to the state environment by reducing or avoiding all emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants."
"Existing law establishes the California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law authorizes the trustees by rule to require all persons to pay fees, rents, deposits, and charges for services, facilities, or materials provided by the trustees to those persons. Existing law prohibits specified California State University campus-based mandatory fees from being reallocated without an affirmative vote of the majority of the members of either the student body or a specified campus fee advisory committee voting on the fee reallocation, unless the vote that established the fee authorizes an alternative or automatic reallocation mechanism for that fee.
Existing law prohibits a campus of the California State University, or the Chancellor of the California State University, from imposing a student success fee, as defined, unless certain requirements are met. Among these requirements is an affirmative vote of a majority of the student body voting at a binding student election.
This bill would increase the affirmative vote required for the imposition of a student success fee from a majority to
2/3
of the student body voting on that proposed fee. The bill would also make a technical conforming change in a related provision.",". The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.) (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Education Code to prohibit a California State University (C State) campus-based mandatory fee, other than a student success fee, from being reallocated without an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of either the student body or a campus fee advisory committee voting on the fee reallocation unless the vote authorized an alternative or automatic reallocation mechanism for that fee. The bill sets forth conditions under which: the campus undertakes a rigorous process that informs and educates students on the uses, impact, and cost of any proposed student success fee or student success fee increase; the campus informs its students of the circumstances under which a student success fee may be rescinded by a majority vote of the students, that a student success fee may not be rescinded earlier than six years following the vote to implement the fee, and that any portion of the student success fee is committed to support a long-term obligation; the campus holds a binding student election on the implementation of any proposed student success fees, or any increase to an existing student success fee, and two-thirds of the student body voting on the fee must vote affirmatively.

Existing law requires the registered process server, before levying under the writ, to deposit a copy of the writ with the levying officer and pay a specified fee. Existing law also permits a registered process server to serve an earnings withholding order on an employer and requires that the process server deposit specified documents with the levying officer and pay a specified fee.
This bill would provide that the registered process server is authorized to have the required documents and fee delivered to the levying officer by someone other than the process server himself or herself.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Code of Civil Procedure to allow a registered process server to levy under a writ of attachment on specified types of property, including: (1) real property; (2) growing crops, timber to be cut, or minerals or the like, including oil and gas, to be extracted or accounts receivable resulting from the sale thereof at the wellhead or minehead; (3) personal property in the custody of a levying officer; (4) equipment of a going business; (5) motor vehicles, vessels, mobilehomes, or commercial coaches used as equipment of a going business; (6) farm products or inventory of a going business; (7) personal property used as a dwelling; (8) deposit accounts; and (9) interest of a defendant in personal property in the estate of a decedent.

"(1) Existing law prohibits the suspension, or recommendation for expulsion, of a pupil from school unless the superintendent of the school district or the principal of the school determines that the pupil has committed any of various specified acts, including, but not limited to, engaging in an act of bullying by means of an electronic act. Existing law defines “electronic act” as the creation or transmission originated on or off the schoolsite, by means of an electronic device, including, but not limited to, a telephone, wireless telephone, or other wireless communication device, computer, or pager, of a communication, including, but not limited to, a message, text, sound, or image, or a post on a social network Internet Web site.
This bill would expressly include a video within the definition of what constitutes an electronic act.

"(1) Existing law, known as the Donahoe Higher Education Act, sets forth the missions and functions of the segments of postsecondary education in this state. The California State University, under the administration of the Trustees of the California State University, the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and the University of California, under the administration of the Regents of the University of California, constitute the 3 segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Provisions of the Donahoe Higher Education Act apply to the University of California only to the extent that the regents act, by appropriate resolution, to make those provisions applicable.
An existing chapter of the Donahoe Higher Education Act relates to the use of academic materials, and provides that a court of competent jurisdiction is authorized to grant relief that is necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter, including through the issuance of an injunction.
This chapter also includes the College Textbook Transparency Act which, among other things, provides that certain faculty members, defined as adopters, are authorized to receive royalties or other compensation from sales of course materials that include the instructor’s writing or other work, subject to the employer’s standing policies or collective bargaining agreements relating to employee conflicts of interest.
This bill would add to this chapter a provision that requires the trustees and the governing board of each community college district, and requests the regents, to require their faculty members to annually disclose, on or before April 15, 2017, and on or before April 15 of each year thereafter, on a form and in a manner to be determined by the trustees, the governing board, or the regents, as appropriate, all of the income he or she received in the immediately preceding calendar year from a publisher, periodical, or provider of online content for royalties, advances, consulting services, or for any other purpose.
The bill would require faculty members to whom the bill is applicable to file a form even if they have no disclosable income in the calendar year. The bill would require that these forms be filed under penalty of perjury, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program by expanding the scope of the crime of perjury.
The bill would require that the information provided by the faculty members under this bill be available to the public on the Internet Web site of the institution at which the faculty members teach, as specified. The bill would authorize the trustees, community college governing boards, or regents to require a faculty member who does not file the information required under this bill in a timely manner to pay an administrative fine of up to
25% of the unreported income or $5,000, whichever is smaller,
$50,
as specified.
The bill would authorize the trustees and the community college district governing boards to expend the proceeds of these fines for general educational purposes at the campuses at which the faculty members who were assessed the fines were employed. With respect to the California State University, the bill would establish the California State University Faculty Royalty Disclosure Fund as a continuously appropriated fund for the deposit of fine proceeds and their allocation to the appropriate campuses. The bill would request the regents to allocate the proceeds of any administrative fines they collect pursuant to the bill in a manner similar to that described for the California State University.
To the extent that this provision would impose new duties on community college districts, this bill would constitute a state-mandated local program.
(2)The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

"(1) The California State Lottery Act of 1984, enacted by initiative, authorizes a California State Lottery and provides for its operation and administration by the California State Lottery Commission and the Director of the California State Lottery, with certain limitations. The act establishes the California State Lottery Education Fund and provides for direct payments from the fund to various entities, including the Board of Trustees of the California State University. The act requires funds received by the trustees to be deposited in, and expended from, the California State University Lottery Education Fund or, at the discretion of the trustees, deposited in local trust accounts.
Existing law establishes the California State University Trust Fund and specifies its sources of revenue. Existing law provides that all money received by the fund shall augment the support appropriation to the California State University for the fiscal year to which the collections apply.
This bill would require the trustees to deposit funds received from the California State Lottery Education Fund in the California State University Trust Fund instead of the California State University Lottery Education Fund. The bill would continue to allow the trustees, in their discretion, to deposit the funds in local trust accounts.
(2) The California State Lottery Act of 1984, an initiative measure, specifies that none of its provisions may be changed except to further its purpose by a bill passed by a
2/3
vote of each house of the Legislature and signed by the Governor.
This bill would declare that its provisions further the purposes of the act, as specified, and that the act shall not be interpreted to expand the lawful uses of funds allocated from the California State Lottery Education Fund to the trustees.","Amends the Government Code to require the Controller of the State of California to draw warrants on the California State Lottery Education Fund and distribute quarterly payments specified in specified subdivisions to: (1) public school districts, including county superintendents of schools, serving kindergarten and grades one to 12, inclusive; (2) public school districts serving community colleges, on the basis of an equal amount for each unit of average daily attendance; (3) the Board of Directors of the Hastings College of Law; (4) the two California Schools for the Deaf, the California School for the Blind, and the three Diagnostic Schools for Neurologically Handicapped Children; and (5) the State Department of University Services and the State Department of State Hospitals for clients with developmental or mental disabilities who are enrolled in state hospital education programs, including developmental centers. Declares that it is the intent of the Legislature that all funds allocated from the California State Education Fund be used exclusively for the education-related purpose of enrichment or expansion of schools, or any other noninstructional purpose."
"Existing law, the Gambling Control Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of various legalized gambling activities and establishments by the California Gambling Control Commission and the investigation and enforcement of those activities and establishments by the Department of Justice. A willful violation of the act is a misdemeanor. Existing law requires every person who is required to hold a state license to obtain the license prior to engaging in the activity or occupying the position with respect to which the license is required, except as specified. Existing law also requires every person who, by order of the commission, is required to apply for a gambling license or a finding of suitability to file an application within 45 calendar days after receipt of the order.
This bill would instead require the application described above to be filed within 60 calendar days after receipt of an order of the commission.
Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for a person who deals, plays, or carries on, opens, or causes to be opened, or who conducts, either as owner or employer, whether for hire or not, any of a list of specified gambling games, or any banking or percentage game played with cards, dice, or any device, for money, checks, credit, or any representative of value.
Existing law generally requires a person to be deemed unsuitable to hold a state gambling license under the California Gambling Control Act to own a gambling establishment if the person, or any partner, officer, director, or shareholder of that person, has any financial interest in any business or organization that is engaged in any form of gambling prohibited under the provision described above, whether within or without this state. Existing law exempts from these provisions a person who meets specified criteria, including a person who is licensed or had an application to be licensed on file with the commission on or before February 1, 2013. Existing law requires a person exempt under this provision, within 3 years of the date the closed business or organization reopens or becomes engaged in any form of gambling prohibited under the provision described above, to either divest that person’s interest in the business or organization or divest that person’s interest in the gambling enterprise or gambling establishment for which the person is licensed or has applied to be licensed by the commission.
During this 3-year divestment period, existing law makes it unlawful for any cross-promotion or marketing, as defined, to occur between the business or organization that is engaged in any form of gambling prohibited under the provision described above, and a gambling enterprise or gambling establishment.
This bill would instead require an exempt person, within 6 years of the date the closed business or organization reopens or becomes engaged in any form of gambling prohibited under the provision described above, to either divest that person’s interest in the business or organization or divest that person’s interest in the gambling enterprise or gambling establishment for which the person is licensed or has applied to be licensed by the commission. The bill would also make conforming changes. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would require the City of Inglewood, by July 1, 2018, to prepare and submit a report to the Legislature and appropriate policy committees of the Legislature on the progress of the construction of the City of Champions Revitalization Project and its impact on the divestment requirement described above. By imposing a reporting requirement on the City of Inglewood, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of Inglewood.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to require a person required to hold a state gambling license to obtain the license prior to engaging in the activity or occupying the position with respect to which the license is required. (Sec. 2) The bill prohibits a person from holding a state gambling license to own a gambling establishment if the person, or any partner, officer, director, or shareholder of the person, has any financial interest in any business or organization that is engaged in any form of gambling prohibited by the federal criminal code within or without California. The prohibition does not apply to a publicly traded racing association, a qualified racing association, or any person who is licensed pursuant to such Act. Exempts from such prohibition: the person is licensed or had an application to be licensed on file with the California Horse Racing Commission on or before February 1, 2013; the person has a financial interest in a gambling establishment that is located on any portion of, or contiguous to, the grounds on which a racetrack is or had been previously located and horse race meetings were authorized to be conducted by the California Horse Racing Board on or before January 1, 2012; the grounds upon which the gambling establishment is located are directly or indirectly owned by a racetrack limited partnership owner; or within six years of the date"
"The
(1) The
Horse Racing Law permits the California Horse Racing Board to authorize an association licensed to conduct a racing meeting to also operate a satellite wagering facility at its racetrack inclosure, under specified conditions that differ between the northern zone and the central and southern zones, and provides specific guidelines for the operation and location of these facilities. That law also authorizes fairs to contract for the operation and management of a satellite wagering facility with an individual racing association or a partnership, joint venture, or other affiliation of 2 or more racing associations that are licensed to conduct thoroughbred meetings within the northern zone.
This bill would authorize a fair to contract with 2 or more fairs that are licensed to conduct thoroughbred meetings within the northern zone for the operation and management of a satellite wagering facility.
(2) The Horse Racing Law provides that any unallocated balance from the total revenue received by the Department of Food and Agriculture pursuant to that law, except as specified, is hereby appropriated without regard to fiscal years for allocation by the Secretary of Food and Agriculture for capital outlay to California fairs for, among other things, fair projects involving public health and safety and projects that are required to protect fair property. That law also provides that a portion of these funds may be allocated to California fairs for general support.
This bill would revise these provisions to include revenue deposited into the Fair and Exposition Fund pursuant to a specified provision and funding appropriated by the Legislature or otherwise designated for California fairs pursuant to the Horse Racing Law or any other law that is to be appropriated without regard to fiscal years for allocation by the secretary for those capital outlay purposes.
(3) Existing law provides that all funds appropriated for California fairs and expositions pursuant to specified provisions of law shall not be utilized for the purposes specified in those provisions but shall instead be utilized for the construction or operation of recreational and cultural facilities of general public interest and may be allocated by the Secretary of Food and Agriculture to all state designated fairs for those purposes.
This bill would delete these provisions and instead require that all funds appropriated or designated for California fairs and expositions pursuant to specified law or any other law be deposited in the Fair and Exposition Fund and be continuously appropriated as provided in specified provisions of the Horse Racing Law.
(4) By increasing the amounts to be deposited in the Fair and Exposition Fund, which is continuously appropriated, and by appropriating these amounts for new purposes, the bill would make an appropriation.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Business and Professions Code (the Code) to authorize a racing association licensed to conduct a racing meeting in the northern zone to operate a satellite wagering facility for wagering on races conducted in that zone at its racetrack inclosure subject to specified conditions and limitations. Prohibits any satellite wagering facility, except one located at a track where live racing is conducted, from being located within 20 miles of any existing satellite wagering facility or of any track where a racing association conducts a live racing meeting. Allows a racing association or any existing satellite wagering facility to waive the prohibition and to consent to the location of another such facility within 20 miles of the facility or track. Specifies that the Department of Food and Agriculture may approve not more than three satellite wagering facilities that are licensed jointly to the 1a District Agricultural Association and the 5a District Agricultural Association and that are located on specified subdivisions of the 1a District Agricultural Association or within the boundaries of the City and County of San Francisco. Requires the Department to conduct a one-year test at the proposed site in order to determine the impact of the proposed facility on total State parimutuel revenues and on attendance and wagering existing racetracks and fair satellite wagering facilities in the Counties of Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara"
"Existing law defines the term “code enforcement officer” as a person who is not a peace officer, who has enforcement authority for health, safety, and welfare requirements, and who is authorized to issue citations or file formal complaints, as specified.
This bill would require the Board of Directors of the California Association of Code Enforcement Officers (CACEO) to develop and maintain standards for the designation of Certified Code Enforcement Officers or CCEOs. The bill would require the board to designate minimum training, qualifications, and experience requirements for applicants to qualify for the CCEO designation. The bill would also require the board to qualify cities, counties, cities and counties, and accredited educational institutions as Certified Code Enforcement Officer Education Program Providers, and would require all students, participants, or employees who successfully pass the minimum education and certification requirements to be granted CCEO status in an equivalent manner as applicants who attain certification through the CACEO.
The bill would require the board to set annual fees in amounts that are reasonably related and necessary to cover the costs of administering these provisions, to maintain a register of applications for certification, and adopt procedures for discipline, revocation, and sanctions against applicants, registrants, and certificants. The bill would allow all orders of the board resulting in revocation, suspension, or other action to be appealed by a writ of mandate or petition for judicial review to the superior court.","(Sec. 1) Expresses the intent of the Legislature that: (1) there is statewide interest in preventing homes, neighborhoods, commercial properties, and public ways from deteriorating and falling into disrepair; (2) blight adversely impacts community quality-of-life issues, creates hazards and unsafe conditions that endanger the public, causes citizen dissatisfaction, and leads to dangerous buildings, increased crime, and reduced property values; and (3) compliance with this measure be voluntary and not to mandate local agencies or employers to require their code enforcement officers to become certified. (Sec. 2) Expresses the intent of the Legislature to recognize the California Association of Code Enforcement Officers (CACEO) professional development and credentialing program by establishing a Certified Code Enforcement Officer title to help local agencies define, standardize, and regulate this important function. (Sec. 3) Amends the Health and Safety Code to add the Code Enforcement Officer Standards Act to division 20 of that Code. Directs the CACEO Board of Directors to develop and maintain standards for the various classes of Certified Code Enforcement Officers that it designates. Requires the board to develop and maintain standards for education, training, and certification, to be adopted by administrative rule of the board. Prohibits CCEOs from having the power of arrest except as authorized by the city, county,"
"Existing law authorizes the trial court clerk to destroy court records, as defined, after notice of destruction, if there is no request and order for transfer of the records, upon the expiration of specified time periods after final disposition of the case. Existing law generally provides that court records of a criminal proceeding relating to a misdemeanor violation may be destroyed after 5 years, but that court records of a criminal proceeding relating to a misdemeanor violation for speed contests, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or driving under the influence and causing bodily injury, may be destroyed after 10 years.
This bill would decrease the time period that a court record of a misdemeanor violation for speed contests must be retained before it can be destroyed by the trial court clerk from 10 years to 5 years. The bill would increase the time period that a court record of a misdemeanor violation for reckless driving must be retained before it can be destroyed by the trial court clerk from 5 years to 10 years.","Amends the Federal judicial code to authorize the trial court clerk of the State of California to destroy court records if there is no request and order for transfer of the records, except the comprehensive historical and sample superior court records preserved for research under the California Rules of Court, when the following times have expired after the date of final disposition of the case in specified categories: (1) civil actions and proceedings; (2) civil unlimited cases, limited cases, and small claims cases, including after trial de novo, if any; (3) civil judgments for unlimited civil cases; (4) civil judgments in limited and small claims cases; (5) civil harassment, domestic violence, elder and dependent adult abuse, private postsecondary violence, and workplace violence cases; (6) family law, except as otherwise specified; (7) family law, except as otherwise specified; (8) parentage; (9) change of name, gender, or name and gender; and (10) probate."
"The Dental Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of dentists by the Dental Board of California. That act authorizes a committee of the board to evaluate all suggestions or requests for regulatory changes related to the committee and to hold informational hearings in order to report and make appropriate recommendations to the board, after consultation with departmental legal counsel and the board’s chief executive officer. The act requires a committee to include in any report regarding a proposed regulatory change, at a minimum, the specific language or the proposed change or changes and the reasons therefor, and any facts supporting the need for the change.
The act governs the use of general anesthesia, conscious sedation, and oral conscious sedation for pediatric and adult patients. The act makes it unprofessional conduct for a licensee to fail to report the death of a patient, or removal of a patient to a hospital or emergency center for medical treatment, that is related to a dental procedure, as specified. The act also makes it unprofessional conduct for any dentist to fail to obtain the written informed consent of a patient prior to administering general anesthesia or conscious sedation. In the case of a minor, the act requires that the consent be obtained from the child’s parent or guardian.
This bill, which would be known as “Caleb’s Law,” would require the board, on or before January 1, 2017, to provide to the Legislature a report on whether current statutes and regulations for the administration and monitoring of pediatric anesthesia in dentistry provide adequate protection for pediatric dental patients and would require the board to make the report publicly available on the board’s Internet Web site. The bill also would require the board to provide a report on pediatric deaths related to general anesthesia in dentistry at the time of its sunset review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature.
This bill would require that the report of the death of a patient, or removal of a patient to a hospital or emergency center for medical treatment, be on a form or forms approved by the board and that the report include specified information. The bill authorizes the board to assess a penalty on any licensee who fails to make the required report.
This bill, with regard to obtaining written informed consent for general anesthesia or conscious sedation in the case of a minor, would require that the written informed consent include specified information regarding anesthesia, as provided.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 5, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill urges the state of California to encourage dental providers to submit data regarding pediatric sedation events to a pediatric sedation research database maintained by a nonprofit organization, the goal of which shall be to formulate a systems-based approach to improve the quality of services provided to pediatric dental anesthesia patients in outpatient settings. (Sec. 3) The bill amends the Business and Professions Code to require the California Board of Medical Examiners to: (1) report on whether current statutes and regulations for the administration and monitoring of pediatric anesthesia in dentistry provide adequate protection for pediatric dental patients, and (2) report on pediatric deaths related to dangerous dental sedation at the time of sunset review pursuant to this Act. The bill defines &quot;professional conduct&quot; for purposes of this Act as: the obtaining of any fee by fraud or misrepresentation; the employment directly or indirectly of any student or suspended or unlicensed dentist to practice; the aiding or abetting of any person to practice dentistry unlawfully; the committing of any act or acts of sexual abuse, misconduct, or relations with a patient that are substantially related to the practice of dentistry; the use of any false, assumed, or fictitious name; the practice of"
"Existing law requires the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to issue authorizations for a teacher to provide specific services to limited-English-proficient pupils, if certain minimum requirements are met.
This bill would provide that a teacher who possesses any of several specified California credentials or permits, and who is able to present a valid out-of-state credential or certificate that authorizes content instruction delivered in a pupil’s primary language, may qualify for that authorization by submitting an application and a fee to the commission.","Amends the Education Code to revise California teaching credential requirements for teachers of limited-English-proficient pupils, with respect to instruction in preschool, kindergarten, grades one to 12, inclusive, and classes primarily for adults. Directs the California Education Commission to issue an authorization for a teacher to provide all such services if a specified requirement is satisfied by the possession of: (1) a children's center instructional permit or a childrens center supervision permit; or (2) a designated subjects teaching credential in adult education."
"Existing law establishes the Department of Parks and Recreation and vests the department with the control of the state park system. Existing law authorizes the Director of Parks and Recreation to negotiate or renegotiate a concession contract within state parks if specified conditions exist and generally requires that a concession contract within state parks for a period of more than 2 years be awarded to the best responsible bidder.
This bill would enact the California Heritage Protection Act, which would make various changes to the process for negotiating or renegotiating state parks concession contracts. The bill would modify the definition of a best responsible bidder to include that the bidder, among other things, will operate the concession in a manner that protects the state’s trademark and service mark interest in the names associated with a state park venue and its historical, cultural, and recreational resources.
This bill would prohibit a concession contract from providing a contracting party with a trademark or service mark interest in the name or names associated with a state park venue, or its historical, cultural, or recreational resources, and would prohibit a concession contract from serving as the basis for any legal claim that the contracting party has that interest. The bill would declare that these provisions do not constitute a change in, but are declaratory of, existing law. The bill would prohibit a bidder who makes that legal claim or assertion, and a bidder who a court has determined has made that legal claim or assertion with respect to a state or federal park venue without reasonable cause and in bad faith, from being awarded a concession contract within state parks. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations to provide a bidder who is denied a contract award based on these reasons with written notice and an opportunity to rebut the basis of the contract denial at a formal hearing. The bill would render a provision of a concession contract that, on and after January 1, 2017, provides a contracting party with a trademark or service mark interest in the name or names associated with a state park venue, or its historical, cultural, or recreational resources, void and unenforceable.
This bill would require a concession contract to contain provisions requiring the concessionaire to forfeit the right to bid on future state park concession contracts if the concessionaire makes the above-described legal claim or assertion and requiring a concessionaire to be responsible for the state’s attorney fees, costs, and expenses if the concessionaire in bad faith files a federal or state trademark or service mark application for a trademark or service mark that incorporates or implies association with a state park venue, or its historical, cultural, or recreational resources, and the state files a successful opposition or cancellation of the trademark or service mark application.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 5080.18 of the Public Resources Code proposed by SB 1473 to be operative only if SB 1473 and this bill are chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.","California Heritage Protection Act - Declares that it is important that the Legislature clarify that an awarded concession contract within Californias State Parks does not give the concessionaire a trademark right to the name or names associated with a State Park venue or its historical, cultural, or recreational resources. Declares that a concessionaire who makes a legal claim to have such a trademark right should be disqualified from further consideration as a bidder. Specifies that all contracts authorizing occupancy of any portion of the State Park System for a period of more than two years shall be awarded to the best responsible bidder. (Currently, all contracts authorize occupancy of any portion of the System for a period of more than two years and all contracts are subject to competitive bidding.) Specifies that: (1) a concession contract shall contain, but is not limited to, all of the following provisions: (1) the maximum term shall be ten years if the director determines that the longer term is necessary to allow the concessionaire to allow the full utilization of lodging improvements made by the concessionaire to facilitate the full utilization of a structure scheduled for replacement or redevelopment, or to serve complementary interests of the State; (2) all renewals of concession contracts shall be subject to competitive bidding requirements; and (3) a concession agreement at Will Rogers State Beach may"
"Existing law regulates the voting procedures for military or overseas voters and provides that a military or overseas voter has the right to register for, and to vote by a vote by mail ballot in, any election within the state. Existing law defines a “ballot marking system” as any mechanical, electromechanical, or electronic system and its software that is used for the sole purpose of marking a ballot for a military or overseas voter.
This bill would rename a “ballot marking system” as a “remote accessible vote by mail system.” The bill would define a “remote accessible vote by mail system” as a mechanical, electromechanical, or electronic system and its software that is used for the sole purpose of marking an electronic vote by mail ballot remotely, outside a polling location, for a voter with disabilities or a military or overseas voter who would then be required to print the paper cast vote record to be submitted to the elections official. The bill would also make conforming changes.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Elections Code, with respect to voting systems and remote accessible votes by mail, to revise the definitions of: (1) &quot;ballot&quot; to mean any card with number positions that is marked by the voter, the accompanying reference page or pages containing the names of candidates and the ballot titles of measures to be voted on, one or more cards upon which are printed the names of the candidates and the ballot titles of measures to be voted on, one or more sheets of paper upon which are printed the names of candidates and the ballot titles of measures to be voted on, manually or by optical scanning equipment, and an electronic touchscreen upon which appears the names of candidates and ballot titles of measures to be voted on by touching the designated area on the screen for systems that do not contain a paper ballot; (2) &quot;remote accessible vote by mail system&quot; to mean a mechanical, electromechanical, or electronic system and its software that is used for the sole purpose of marking an electronic vote by mail ballot for a voter with disabilities or a military or overseas voter who shall print the paper cast vote record to be submitted to the elections official; and (3) &quot;paper cast vote record&quot; to mean an auditable"
"(1) The Ralph M. Brown Act requires, with specified exceptions, that all meetings of a legislative body of a local agency, as those terms are defined, be open and public and that all persons be permitted to attend and participate. The act further requires the legislative body of a local agency to post, at least 72 hours before the meeting, an agenda containing a brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at a regular meeting, in a location that is freely accessible to members of the public and to provide a notice containing similar information with respect to a special meeting at least 24 hours prior to the special meeting. The act requires that the agenda or notice be freely accessible to members of the public and be posted on the local agency’s Internet Web site, if the local agency has one.
This bill would require an online posting of an agenda for a meeting occurring on and after January 1, 2019, of a legislative body of a city, county, city and county, special district, school district, or political subdivision established by the state that has an Internet Web site to be posted on the local agency’s primary Internet Web site homepage accessible through a prominent, direct link, as specified. The bill would exempt a legislative body of a city, county, city and county, special district, school district, or political subdivision established by the state that has an Internet Web site from this requirement if it has an integrated agenda management platform that meets specified requirements, including, among others, that the current agenda is the first agenda available at the top of the integrated agenda management platform. The bill would authorize an integrated agenda management platform to include prior meeting agendas, as specified. The bill would require any agenda posted pursuant to these provisions to be in an open format that meets specified requirements, including, among others, that the agenda is platform independent and machine readable. The bill would also define terms for these purposes.

This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires, for at least 72 hours before a regular meeting, the legislative body of a local agency to post an agenda containing a brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at the meeting, including items to be discussed in closed session.

"Existing law prescribes the circumstances under which property held or owing by a business association escheats to the state. Existing law specifies that any demand, savings, or matured time deposit, or account subject to a negotiable order of withdrawal, made with a banking organization escheats to the state if the owner, for more than three years, has not increased or decreased the amount of the deposit. Existing law specifies that any demand, savings, or matured time deposit, or matured investment certificate, or account subject to a negotiable order of withdrawal, or other interest in a financial organization, escheats to the state when the owner, for more than three years, has not increased or decreased the amount of the funds or deposit.
This bill would require, commencing on or before January 1, 2018, for purposes of determining whether the above-described property escheats to the state, that a holder, as defined in existing law, regard specified transactions that are initiated electronically and are reflected in the books and records of a banking or financial organization as evidence of an increase or decrease in the amount of the funds or deposit in an account held by the banking or financial organization.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 6, 2003.

"Existing law prohibits a person from being tried, adjudged to punishment, or having his or her probation, mandatory supervision, postrelease community supervision, or parole revoked while that person is mentally incompetent. Existing law establishes a process by which a defendant’s mental competency is evaluated and by which the defendant receives treatment, including, if applicable, antipsychotic medication, with the goal of returning the defendant to competency. Existing law credits time spent by a defendant in a state hospital or other facility as a result of commitment during the process toward the term of any imprisonment for which the defendant is sentenced.
Existing law, as added by Proposition 184, adopted November 8, 1994, and amended by Proposition 36, adopted November 6, 2012, commonly known as the Three Strikes Law, prohibits certain recidivist offenders from being committed to any facility other than a state prison.
This bill would authorize, if a defendant has pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or been convicted of, an offense that will result in a sentence to state prison or county jail, the defendant or the prosecutor submit evidence that the defendant suffers from a diagnosable mental condition that was a substantial factor that contributed to the defendant’s criminal conduct. The bill would require that the evidence be submitted after the defendant’s conviction, but before his or her sentencing. The bill would require the court to consider any evidence submitted as described above in conjunction with the defendant’s sentencing, and would authorize the court to order the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or county jail authority, as applicable, to place the defendant in a residential mental health treatment facility. This placement would not be available to a defendant who is subject to the Three Strikes Law. The bill would also authorize the court to order the department or jail authority to place the defendant in a mental health program within the state prison or county jail, respectively. The bill would provide that the defendant has the right to counsel for these proceedings.

The bill would authorize a court, if it finds that the defendant has shown that he or she meets the criteria by a preponderance of the evidence, to order the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the county authority to provide specified mental health service, including placement in a residential mental health treatment facility instead of state prison or county jail, placement in a mental health program within the state prison or county jail, or preparation of a postrelease mental health treatment plan. The bill would authorize the court, upon petition of the defendant or the prosecution, to recall a sentence that includes a mental health order and resentence the defendant to other mental health treatment or resentence the defendant without mental health treatment. The bill would provide that the defendant has the right to counsel for these proceedings.
By imposing additional duties upon county jail authorities, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on May 17, 2010.

A violation of these standards and regulations under specific circumstances is a crime.
This bill would, by June 1, 2017, require the division to convene an advisory committee to develop a regulation that requires a health facility to evacuate or remove plume through the use of a plume scavenging system in all settings that employ techniques that involve the creation of plume and would authorize certain entities and people to be on the advisory committee, including, among others, practicing physicians and surgeons from affected specialties. The bill would require the division, in developing the regulation to do certain things, including evaluating the use of certain standards adopted by specified organizations as a benchmark. The bill would also require the division, when developing the proposed regulation, to take into consideration recommendations on the evacuation of plume from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration or National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The bill would, by June 1, 2018, require the division to submit to the board the proposed regulation. The bill would, by July 1, 2019, require the board to adopt the proposed regulation.
The bill would provide that compliance with general room ventilation standards or the use of surgical masks does not satisfy the requirements for protection from surgical plumes under these provisions. The bill would provide that the use of respirators does not satisfy the requirements for protection from surgical plumes under these provisions, except as specified. The bill would require the manufacturer of a plume scavenging system to provide evidence that the system meets specified minimum requirements when installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
The bill would specify that these provisions do not limit the authority of the division to develop, or limit the authority of the board to adopt, a regulation with a broader scope or broader application than required by these provisions.
By expanding the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires the Division of Occupational Safety and Health of the Department of Labor to convene an advisory committee to develop a regulation that requires a health facility to evacuate or remove plume, which is noxious airborne contaminants generated as of the use of energy-based devices, electrosurgical devices, or mechanical tools during surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures. The advisory committee may include health facilities, practicing physicians and surgeons from affected specialties, registered nurses and other affected health care personnel, labor and specialty organizations representing registered nurses, labor and specialty organizations representing other affected health care personnel, and other stakeholders."
"(1) The California Credit Union Law provides for the regulation of credit unions within the state by the Commissioner of Business Oversight. The law requires a credit union to be directed by a board of directors consisting of an odd number of directors, at least 5 in number, each of whom are a member of the credit union, to be elected by the members at their annual meeting. The law requires a credit union to have a supervisory committee of at least 3 persons, each of whom is a member of the credit union. The law authorizes the directors to delegate the approval of applications for new memberships to any officer, director, committee member, or employee pursuant to a written membership plan adopted by the board, provided the board reviews, at least quarterly, a report of membership applications approved by an officer, director, committee member, or employee.
This bill would require the board to meet on a regular basis, not less than quarterly, as reasonably determined by the board. The bill would require the membership of the supervisory committee to be an odd number and would authorize, in lieu of the requirement for a supervisory committee, the establishment of an audit committee and the selection of the members of the audit committee. The bill would remove the requirement for the directors to, at least quarterly, review a report of membership applications approved by an officer, director, committee member, or employee to whom the directors delegated the authority to approve applications for new membership.
(2) The California Credit Union Law prohibits an obligation with a member that is not a natural person and results in liability to the credit union in excess of that member’s investment in the credit union unless an exception is authorized in the credit union’s bylaws and approved by the commissioner. The law authorizes any lending activity permitted pursuant to this provision to be terminated by the commissioner pursuant to a specific procedure.
This bill would repeal this prohibition.
(3) The California Credit Union Law limits the circumstances when a nonmember may participate in an obligation or extension of credit to a member as a joint applicant or co-obligor.
This bill would include the terms coborrower, surety, and guarantor within these provisions.
(4) The California Credit Union Law limits a credit union from entering, directly or indirectly, into any obligation with an official, and defines that term to mean a director, officer, member of the supervisory committee, or member of the credit committee of a credit union.
This bill would modify that definition to remove the position of an officer, and to include the positions of a member of the audit committee, credit manager, president, and chief executive officer of a credit union.
(5) The California Credit Union Law requires any application for any loan or extension or guarantee of credit, except as specified, to state in writing the purpose for which the loan or extension or guarantee of credit is desired, and, if applicable, describe the property that is proposed to secure the loan or extension or guarantee of credit.
This bill would repeal this requirement.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Financial Code, with respect to requirements for credit union bylaws, to specify that the bylaws shall prescribe the manner in which the business of a credit union shall be conducted with reference to: (1) the purpose of the credit union; (2) the qualification for membership; (3) the manner of conducting meetings; (4) the number of members which shall constitute a quorum; (5) the authorized number of directors, the number of directors necessary to constitute a quorum, and the powers and duties of officers elected by the directors; and (6) the membership, powers, and duties of the credit committee or if applicable, the general powers, responsibilities, and duties of the credit manager. (Sec. 2) A credit union with total assets equal to or greater than ten million dollars ($10 million) shall, within 105 days after the end of each fiscal year or within any extended time that the Financial Code commissioner may specify, file with the commissioner an audit report for the fiscal year. The audit report shall: (1) contain the audited financial statements of the credit union for, or as of the end of the fiscal year, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that the commissioner may specify; and (2) be prepared by an independent certified public accountant or independent public accountant who is acceptable to the"
"Existing law, the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), an initiative measure enacted by the voters as Proposition 63 at the November 2, 2004, statewide general election, establishes the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission. Existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services, in consultation with the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission and the County Behavioral Health Directors Association of California, to develop and administer instructions for the Annual Mental Health Services Act Revenue and Expenditure Report, which gathers specified information on mental health spending as a result of the MHSA, including the expenditures of funds distributed to each county.
This bill would require the department, based on the Annual Mental Health Services Act Revenue and Expenditure Report, to compile information, in total and by county on an annual basis, that includes, among other things, the total amount of MHSA revenue, the amount of MHSA money received and expended for each specified component of the MHSA program, and the amount of MHSA money spent on program administration. The bill would require the department to make the collected information available to the Legislature and the public on its Internet Web site no later than July 1, 2018, and annually thereafter.","This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to require the State Department of Health Care Services to develop and administer instructions for the Annual Mental Health Services Act Revenue and Expenditure Report. The report must be submitted electronically to the department and to the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission. The department and the commission shall annually post each county's report on its website in a timely manner. The purpose of the report is to: identify the expenditures of the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) funds that were distributed to each county, the amount of additional funds generated for the mental health system as a result of the MHSA, identify unexpended funds, and interest earned on MHSA funds, determine reversion amounts, and determine reversion amounts, if applicable, from prior fiscal year distributions; and provide information that allows for evaluation of all of the following: children's systems of care; prevention and early intervention strategies; innovative projects; workforce education and training; adults and older adults systems of care; capital facilities and technology needs; and other mental health services not reflected in the report. Based on the report, the department must collect and publicly report all of the following information, statewide total and by individual county: total revenue received from the MHSA; the amount of MHSA funds received"
"The California Constitution requires the Governor to immediately call an election to fill a vacancy in the Legislature. Existing law provides specific procedures for the nomination and election of candidates at any special election to fill a vacancy in the office of State Senator or Member of the Assembly.
Exiting law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, provides that contributions deposited into a campaign account are deemed to be held in trust for expenses associated with the election of a candidate or for expenses associated with holding office. The act provides that campaign funds under the control of a former candidate or elected officer are considered surplus campaign funds at a prescribed time, and it prohibits the use of surplus campaign funds except for specified purposes.
This bill would prohibit a State Senator or Member of the Assembly who decides to resign from office before the expiration of his or her term from subsequently using campaign funds held in trust for any purpose other than paying outstanding campaign debts or reasonable expenses. The bill would amend the list of specified purposes allowable for the use of surplus campaign funds to include the payment of expenses to hold a special election to fill the vacancy created by the Member’s resignation and would require the former Member to pay from his or her surplus campaign funds such election-related expenses, to the extent he or she has funds available to do so. Once election-related expenses are paid, this bill would limit the use of excess surplus funds to
charitable
certain
purposes.
This bill would further make a Member who, after deciding to resign, uses campaign funds for purposes other than those authorized in that circumstance personally liable for expenses to hold a special election.
A violation of the provisions of the Political Reform Act of 1974 is punishable as a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.","Amends the State Election Code to require a former State Senator or Member of the Assembly who resigns from office before the expiration of his or her term to reimburse from his or her campaign funds the county or counties that hold a special election for any expenses authorized and necessarily incurred in the preparation for, and conduct of, the special election. Specifies that if the legislative district encompasses more than one county, surplus campaign funds shall be prorated among the counties conducting the special election in the proportion of the district each county composes. Declares that if a State Senator or Member of the Assembly decides to resign from office before the expiration of his or her term, he or she shall only use funds held pursuant to this Act to pay outstanding campaign debts or reasonable expenses. Subjects funds held pursuant to this Act to the extent they become surplus funds, with the presumption that there is a rebuttable presumption that a Senator or Member of the Assembly who resigns decided to do so six months before he or she vacated office.

"(1) Existing law, the State Civil Service Act, provides for filling certain state positions through the process of examinations and the establishment of eligible lists and promotional lists. Existing law requires the Department of Human Resources to administer the Personnel Classification Plan of the State of California, including the allocation of every position to the appropriate class in the classification plan.
Existing law requires the Department of Human Resources to administer the Limited Examination and Appointment Program (LEAP) to provide an alternative to the traditional civil service examination and appointment process to facilitate the hiring of persons with disabilities in state civil service. Existing law requires the department to conduct competitive examinations to determine eligibility for appointment under LEAP and to refer the names of eligible applicants who meet the minimum qualifications of a job classification to the appointing powers for examination appointments, as specified.
Existing law authorizes the Employment Development Department to contract with a specified nonprofit organization meeting specified criteria to manage grant programs designed to help eligible at-risk youth complete their secondary education and acquire the skills necessary to successfully transition into the workforce or enroll in postsecondary education.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations regarding the state’s responsibility for the well-being of foster youth and former foster youth. The bill, until January 1, 2020, would require the Department of Human Resources to establish an emancipated foster youth program to promote the training of qualified foster youth in specified entry-level unclassified positions for their eventual hiring in classified positions within Sacramento with any state agency or department as determined by the department. The bill would require a participant in the program to pass a written examination for the classification in which he or she is trained, if generally required for applicants in that classification, after 3 months, but before 9 months, of training.
(2) Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary schools in this state, and authorizes local educational agencies throughout the state to operate schools and provide instruction to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. Existing law establishes the Consolidated Work Program Fund in the State Treasury for the receipt of all moneys deposited pursuant to the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. Existing law provides that moneys in the fund are to be made available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the Employment Development Department, for expenditure consistent with the purposes of the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act and the state plan required by the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.
This bill would require the Sacramento County Office of Education to develop and administer the
Former
Foster Youth Job Readiness Training Pilot Program with moneys appropriated by the Legislature for that purpose. The bill would appropriate $1,100,000 from the Consolidated Work Program Fund to the Sacramento County Office of Education to develop an application and create criteria for selecting eligible organizations to provide job readiness training to eligible participants. The bill would require the Sacramento County Office of Education to award grants to selected eligible organizations to pay for trainers to provide job readiness training to eligible participants and to provide a stipend to eligible participants who satisfy specified conditions. The bill would require the Sacramento County Office of Education to compile information regarding participation in the program. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2020.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Sacramento County Office of Education.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill directs the Sacramento County Office of Education to develop and administer a program to prepare foster youth who are 18 to 25 years of age for entry-level employment in California state service by developing an application and creating criteria for selecting organizations to provide job readiness training to eligible participants. The office shall award grants to selected organizations to pay trainers to provide such training and a stipend to an eligible participant who: remains actively engaged in and attends the training, and has not received a high school diploma or high school equivalency certificate, or enrolls, is actively engaged in, and attends a high school equivalency exam preparation class. The office shall compile data on the number of participants enrolling in the program, the number of participants completing the program, the number of participants receiving a placement after completing the program, and the number of participants receiving state employment after completing a placement."
"Existing law provides that the California Workforce Development Board is responsible for assisting the Governor in the development, oversight, and continuous improvement of California’s workforce investment system. Existing law requires that the California Workforce Development Board and each local workforce development board ensure that programs and services funded by the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 and directed to apprenticeable occupations are conducted in coordination with apprenticeship programs approved by the Division of Apprenticeship Standards, as specified. Existing law also requires the California Workforce Development Board and each local workforce development board to develop a policy of fostering collaboration between community colleges and approved apprenticeship programs in the geographic area.
This bill would require the California Workforce Development Board and each local board to ensure that federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 funds respectively awarded by them for preapprenticeship training in the building and construction trades fund programs and services that follow the Multi-Craft Core Curriculum implemented by the State Department of Education and that develop a plan to help increase the representation of women in those trades, as specified. The bill would require the California Workforce Development Board to develop policies to implement these provisions. By imposing new requirements on the local workforce development boards, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill amends the Unemployment Insurance Code to require state and federally funded workforce education, training, and employment programs to be integrated in California's one-stop delivery system to achieve universal access to career services regardless of eligibility requirements. Career services shall be available to adult residents regardless of income, education, employment barriers, or other eligibility requirements. Training services shall be made available to individuals who have met the requirements for career services, have been unable to obtain or retain employment through career services, are in need of training services to obtain or retain employment that leads to economic self-sufficiency or wages comparable to, or higher than, wages from previous employment, have the skills and qualifications to successfully participate in the training, and have selected a program of services directly linked to occupations in demand in the local or regional area."
"Existing law, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, provides that a record or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form and defines an electronic signature for purposes of the act. Existing provisions of the Government Code authorize the use of a digital signature in any written communication with a public entity, and specifies that in those communications, the use of a digital signature has the same force and effect as the use of a manual signature if it complies with specified requirements.
This bill would express the intent of the Legislature to clarify that a digital signature may be used to satisfy the requirements of an electronic signature under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. The bill would, for purposes of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, provide that an electronic signature includes a digital signature under the above described provisions of the Government Code and that a digital signature under those provisions is a type of an electronic signature as set forth in the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act. The bill would also revise the above-described provisions of the Government Code by specifying that if a public entity elects to use a digital signature, that meets specified requirements, the digital signature has the same force and effect of a manual signature in any communication with the public entity.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Civil Code of California to define &quot;digital signature&quot; and &quot;electronic signature&quot; to mean: (1) a sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with an electronic record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the electronic record; and (2) a procedure employed for the purpose of verifying that an electronic signature, record, or performance is that of a specific person or for detecting changes or errors in the information in an electronic record. Defines &quot;electronic record&quot; as a record created, generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means."
"Existing law, the California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act (act), provides specified punishments for certain crimes committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal street gang, as specified. The act defines a “shared gang database” as having various attributes, including, among others, that the database contains personal, identifying information in which a person may be designated as a suspected gang member, associate, or affiliate, or for which entry of a person in the database reflects a designation of that person as a suspected gang member, associate, or affiliate. Existing law requires a law enforcement agency, before designating a person as a suspected gang member, associate, or affiliate in the database, to provide a written notice to the person’s parent or guardian, if the person is a minor.
This bill would require the notice described above to be provided to an adult before designating a person as a suspected gang member, associate, or affiliate in the database. The bill would require these databases to comply with federal requirements regarding the privacy and accuracy of information in the database, and other operating principles for maintaining these databases. The bill would require local law enforcement, commencing January 15, 2018, and every January 15 thereafter to submit specified data pertaining to the database to the Department of Justice, and would require the Department of Justice, commencing February 15, 2018, and every February 15 thereafter, to post that information on the department’s Internet Web site.
By imposing additional duties on local law enforcement entities, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would establish a procedure for a person designated in a shared gang database who has contested that designation with the local law enforcement agency and whose challenge has been denied to appeal to the superior court.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on September 25, 2017. (Sec. 2) This bill amends the state of California's criminal code to include among the requirements a fee for filing any of the following appeals to the court: an appeal of a local law enforcement agency's decision regarding an administrative fine or penalty; an appeal of a law enforcement agency's decision regarding an administrative agency's decision regarding a parking violation; and an appeal under the Public Utilities Code of a hearing officer's determination for the administrative penalty for fare evasion. The bill defines &quot;shared gang database&quot; to mean any database that: allows access for any local law enforcement agency to identify persons in which a person may be designated as a suspected gang member, associate, or affiliate; contains personal, identifying information in which a person may be designated as a suspected gang member, associate, or affiliate; is subject to Part 23 of the Code of Federal Regulations; and does not include dispatch operator reports, information used for the administration of jail or custodial facilities, criminal investigative reports, reports, or information required to be collected pursuant to the California probation system.

"Existing law provides for the administration and operation of juvenile court schools by the county board of education.

Existing law prescribes the course of study a pupil is required to complete while in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in order to receive a diploma of graduation, and authorizes the governing board of a school district to prescribe other coursework requirements that are in addition to the statewide requirements. Existing law exempts pupils in foster care and pupils who are homeless children or youths from local graduation requirements and also requires a school district and county office of education to accept coursework satisfactorily completed by those pupils while attending another public school, a juvenile court school, or a nonpublic, nonsectarian school.
This bill would make that exemption and requirement to accept coursework satisfactorily completed applicable to former juvenile court school pupils, as defined. The bill would also require a county office of education to issue a diploma of graduation to a pupil who completes statewide coursework requirements for graduation while attending a juvenile court school but does not complete coursework and other requirements that are in addition to the statewide graduation requirements.

SEC. 3.
Section 51225.1 of the Education Code is amended to read:
51225.1.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, a school district shall exempt a pupil in foster care, as defined in Section 51225.2, a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, as defined in Section 11434a(2) of Title 42 of the United States Code, or a former juvenile court school pupil, as defined in Section 51225.2, who transfers between schools any time after the completion of the pupil’s second year of high school from all coursework and other requirements adopted by the governing board of the school district that are in addition to the statewide coursework requirements specified in Section 51225.3, unless the school district makes a finding that the pupil is reasonably able to complete the school district’s graduation requirements in time to graduate from high school by the end of the pupil’s fourth year of high school.
(b) If the school district determines that the pupil in foster care, the pupil who is a homeless child or youth, or the former juvenile court school pupil is reasonably able to complete the school district’s graduation requirements within the pupil’s fifth year of high school, the school district shall do all of the following:
(1) Inform the pupil of his or her option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the school district’s graduation requirements.

If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.","(Sec. 1) Declares that it is the intent of the Legislature that pupils in juvenile court schools have a rigorous curriculum that includes a course of study preparing them for high school graduation and career entry and fulfilling the requirements for admission to the University of California and the California State University. (Sec. 2) Requires each public school district and county office of education to accept for credit full or partial coursework satisfactorily completed by a pupil while attending a public school, juvenile court school, or nonpublic, nonsectarian school or agency, the coursework to be transferred by means of the standard state transcript.

"Existing law provides generally for procedures governing civil actions. Existing law imposes additional procedures that apply with respect to limited types of civil actions.
This bill would enact the Asbestos Tort Claim Trust Transparency Act, which would establish additional procedures with respect to civil actions pertaining to asbestos tort claims, as defined. The bill would, among other things, require, that a plaintiff disclose specified information with respect to any asbestos trusts, as defined, against which the plaintiff has or could pursue a claim, and would entitle a defendant to discover relevant information pertaining to the plaintiff held by other asbestos trusts and to pursue various motions.
This bill would require a plaintiff to serve certain statements made under penalty of perjury. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Code of Civil Procedure to allow a party to a civil action who is over 70 years of age to petition the court for a preference, which the court shall grant if the court makes both of the following findings: (1) the party has a substantial interest in the action as a whole; and (2) the health of the party is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party's tort interest in the litigation. Entitles a civil action to recover damages for wrongful death or personal injury to preference upon the motion of any party under 14 years of age unless the court finds that the party does not have a substantial interest in the case as a whole. Permits a party who reaches 70 years of age to file and serve a motion for preference. Authorizes the court to also grant a motion for preference: (1) accompanied by clear and convincing medical documentation that concludes that one of the parties suffers from an illness or condition raising substantial doubt of survival of that party beyond six months, and that satisfies the court that the interests of justice will be served by granting the preference; and (2) that is supported by a showing that the interests of justice will be served by granting the preference.

"Existing law requires the governing board of a school district to adopt a resolution that, among other things: (1) declares its intention to enter into a lease or agreement relating to school property, (2) includes specified information about the property, and (3) fixes a time for a public meeting of the governing board of the school district at which sealed proposals to enter a lease or agreement with the school district will be received from any person, firm, or corporation, and considered by the governing board of the school district, as specified.
Existing law, notwithstanding the provision described above, also authorizes the governing board of a school district, without advertising for bids, to lease real property for a minimum rental of $1 per year if the instrument by which this property is leased requires the lessee to construct, or provide for the construction of, a building to be used by the school district and provides that the title to the building shall vest in the school district at the end of the lease.
This bill would delete the language that provides that the governing board of a school district is not required to advertise for bids pursuant to this provision. The bill would require an instrument created pursuant to these provisions to be awarded based on a competitive solicitation process to the proposer providing the best value, as defined, to the school district. The bill would require the governing board of the school district to adopt and publish required procedures and guidelines for evaluating the qualifications of proposers, as provided. The bill would authorize a school district, for purposes of utilizing preconstruction services, to enter into an instrument before written approval is obtained from the Department of General Services’ Division of the State Architect (DSA) only if the instrument provides that no work for which a contractor is required to be licensed and for which DSA approval is required can be performed before receipt of the required DSA approval.
The bill would provide, for certain projects leased through an instrument before July 1, 2015, if at any time the instrument is determined to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction because it fails to fall within the former competitive bidding exception, that the contractor who entered into the contract with the school district may be paid the reasonable cost, specifically excluding profit, of the labor, equipment, materials, and services furnished by the contractor before the date of the determination, if certain conditions, as determined by the court, are met. The bill would authorize a school district to identify specific types of subcontractors required to be included in a proposal, and would impose specified other procedural requirements on awarding construction subcontracts of a certain value. The bill would provide that the changes made by its provisions, except the deletion of the governing board of a school district’s authority to not advertise for bids, shall become inoperative on July 1, 2022.","This bill amends the Education Code, with respect to California school procurement procedures, to allow the governing board of a school district to let, for a minimum rental of one dollar ($1) a year, a person, firm, or corporation real property that belongs to the school district if the instrument by which this property is let requires the lessee therein to construct on the demised premises, or provide for the construction thereon of, a building or buildings for the use of the school district during the term of the lease. The instrument may provide for the means or methods by which that title shall vest in the school district before the expiration of that term, and shall contain other terms and conditions as the governing board may deem to be in the best interest of the school district. The award of such an instrument shall be based on a competitive solicitation process to the proposer providing the best value to the school district, taking into consideration the proposers demonstrated competence and professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required.

"(1) Existing law prohibits a nonprofit organization or an officer, employee, or agent of a nonprofit organization from using, or permitting another to use, public resources received from a local agency for any campaign activity not authorized by law. Existing law authorizes the Attorney General, any district attorney, or any city attorney of a city with a population over 750,000 to bring a civil action to recover a civil penalty against any person who intentionally or negligently violates that prohibition.
This bill would clarify that the prohibition applies to making contributions or expenditures not authorized by law, and would specify certain expenditures authorized by law that are not subject to the prohibition.
(2) Existing law requires a reporting nonprofit organization that engages in campaign activity to deposit into a separate bank account all specific sources of funds it receives and to pay for all campaign activity from that separate bank account. Existing law defines “reporting nonprofit organization” as a nonprofit organization for which public resources from one or more local agencies account for more than 20% of the nonprofit organization’s annual gross revenue, as specified.
Existing law requires a reporting nonprofit organization that engages in campaign activity of specified amounts or more to periodically disclose to the Franchise Tax Board, and post on its Internet Web site in a certain manner, the identity and amount of each specific source or sources of funds it receives for campaign activity, a description of the campaign activity, and the identity and amount of payments the organization makes from the required separate bank account. Existing law authorizes, and in some instances requires, the Franchise Tax Board to audit a reporting nonprofit organization, requires the board to issue a written audit report, and requires the board to transmit the audit report to the Attorney General and the district attorney for the county in which the reporting nonprofit organization is domiciled. Existing law authorizes the Attorney General or the district attorney for the county in which the reporting nonprofit organization is domiciled to impose a monetary civil penalty of up to $10,000 against a reporting nonprofit organization for misusing public resources received from a local agency, as described in (1), for failing to maintain the separate bank account, or for not complying with the disclosure requirements described above.
This bill would recast and relocate those provisions within the Political Reform Act of 1974, thereby making the Fair Political Practices Commission responsible for their administration and enforcement, except as specified. The bill would change the term “reporting nonprofit organization” to “publicly funded nonprofit organization,” defined as a nonprofit organization for which public resources from one or more local agencies account for more than 20% of the nonprofit organization’s annual gross revenue, as specified. The bill would require certain publicly funded nonprofit organizations to register as recipient committees and file the campaign statements that those committees are required to file under the act. This bill would shift the Franchise Tax Board’s authority and duties under these provisions to the Commission and would authorize the Commission, in addition to the Attorney General or the district attorney, to impose the monetary civil penalty of up to $10,000 against a publicly funded nonprofit organization.
The Political Reform Act of 1974 makes a willful violation of its provisions a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.","Amends the Government Code to prohibit a nonprofit organization or an officer, employee, or agent of such organization from using, or permitting another to use, public resources received from any local agency to make a contribution or expenditure not authorized by law. Declares that this Act does not prohibit the use of public resources for expenditures authorized by law, including the costs of adopting a position or resolution supporting or opposing a clearly identified ballot measure or candidate, the cost of establishing and operating a sponsored committee, and the costs of any office space, telephones, salaries, utilities, supplies, legal accounting fees, and other expenses incurred in establishing and operating a sponsored committee."
"Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to withhold the registration or the transfer of registration of any vehicle or vessel, and to withhold identification or transfer of ownership of any off-highway vehicle subject to identification, until the applicant for registration or identification pays to the department the use tax measured by the sales price of the vehicle or vessel as required by the Sales and Use Tax Law, together with penalty, except as specified. Existing law requires the department to transmit all collections of use tax and penalty to the State Board of Equalization.
This bill would require, in addition, that the department determine all local use taxes the applicant is responsible to pay by specific address data provided by the applicant, and where the vehicle or vessel is to be registered. The bill would require the department to transmit the
address data to the board, and would make the data subject to specified information sharing provisions.
tax area codes and the amount of local use tax and penalty collections attributable to those tax area codes to the board.
This bill would require the board to allocate the use taxes transmitted by the department to the jurisdiction where the purchaser registers the purchased vehicle or vessel by the
specific address

data provided to the board by the department.
This bill would declare the intent of the Legislature that the department and the board administer the provisions relating to registration of vehicles and vessels and identification of off-highway vehicles for these purposes in a manner that ensures that applicable local sales taxes and local transaction and use taxes are collected and then remitted to the specific jurisdiction where the vehicle or vessel is registered.",Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to repeal the State use tax on mobile homes and commercial coaches registered under the Health and Safety Code and on vehicles subject to the permanent trailer identification plate program. (Thus reinstates the State use tax on such vehicles and vessels.)
"Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health to establish a statewide system for the collection of information determining the incidence of cancer, known as the Ken Maddy California Cancer Registry. Existing law authorizes the department to designate any demographic parts of the state as regional cancer incidence reporting areas and establish regional cancer registries to provide cancer incidence data. Existing law requires any hospital or other facility providing therapy to cancer patients within a cancer reporting area to report each case of cancer to the department or the authorized representative of the department in a format prescribed by the department. Existing law provides that if the hospital or other facility fails to report in a format prescribed by the department, the department’s authorized representative is authorized to access the information from the hospital or the facility and report it in the appropriate format. In these cases, existing law requires the hospital or other health facility to reimburse the department or the authorized representative for its cost to access and report the information. Existing law also requires any physician, dentist, podiatrist, or other health care practitioner diagnosing or providing treatment for cancer patients to report each cancer case to the department or the authorized representative of the department, except for those cases directly referred to a treatment facility or those previously admitted to a treatment facility for diagnosis or treatment of that instance of cancer.
This bill, on or after January 1, 2019, would, among other things, require a pathologist diagnosing cancer to report cancer diagnoses to the department by electronic means, including, but not limited to, either directly from an electronic medical record or using a designated Internet Web portal provided by the department. If a pathologist fails to report electronically and with an approved format, the bill would authorize the department’s authorized representative to access the information from the pathologist in an appropriate alternative format. In these cases, the bill would require the pathologist to reimburse the department or the authorized representative for its cost to access and report the information. The bill would require the department to prescribe the data required to be included in the reports and to work collaboratively with stakeholders to designate a standardized electronic format for submission of the reports.","Requires the director of the Health Resources Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a statewide system for the collection of information determining the incidence of cancer, using population-based cancer registries modeled after the Cancer Surveillance Program of the Orange County Health Department. Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the director to establish a statewide system for the collection of information determining the incidence of cancer, using population-based cancer registries modeled after the Cancer Surveillance Program of the Orange County Health Department. Authorizes the department may designate any demographic parts of the state as regional cancer incidence reporting areas and to establish regional cancer registries."
"Existing law requires the Instructional Quality Commission, on or before July 31, 2019, to consider developing and recommending to the State Board of Education computer science content standards for kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, pursuant to recommendations developed by a group of computer science experts convened by the Superintendent of Public Instruction in consultation with the state board.
This bill would require the Superintendent to convene, on or before September 1, 2017, a computer science strategic implementation advisory panel composed of 23 members, as specified, to develop and submit recommendations for a computer science strategic implementation plan to the State Department of Education, the state board, and the Legislature on or before July 1, 2018. The bill would require the department and the state board to consider the advisory panel’s recommendations; the department to develop, and the state board to adopt, a computer science strategic implementation plan on or before January 1, 2019; and the department to submit the plan adopted by the state board to the Legislature on or before January 1, 2019. The bill would require the Superintendent to appoint a statewide computer science liaison to serve the advisory panel, as provided. The bill would authorize the advisory panel, if state or federal funds are not available or sufficient for purposes of these provisions, to evaluate the process and ability to accept grants and receive donations and other financial support from public or private sources for purposes of convening the advisory panel, preparing the computer science strategic implementation plan, and ensuring that the computer science strategic implementation plan adopted by the state board is implemented. The bill’s provisions would be repealed on January 1, 2021.","This bill requires the Superintendent of Education in California to convene an advisory panel to develop recommendations for a computer science strategic implementation plan. The panel must hold public meetings, post the location and time of the meetings, and post online. The bill requires the advisory panel to consist of members who have expertise in computer science education and are designated by the governor and the Speaker of the Assembly."
"The Real Estate Law provides for the licensure and regulation of real estate brokers and real estate salespersons by the Bureau of Real Estate headed by the Real Estate Commissioner. Existing law requires the commissioner to provide on the Internet specific information regarding the status of every license issued by the department. That law requires a real estate broker to immediately notify the commissioner in writing whenever a real estate salesperson enters the employ of or is terminated by that real estate broker. That law makes a willful or knowing violation of any if its provisions punishable as a misdemeanor.
This bill would, beginning January 1, 2018, require that information to include whether a licensee is an associate licensee and, if the associate licensee is a broker, to identify each responsible broker with whom the licensee is contractually associated. This bill would additionally require a real estate broker to immediately notify the commissioner in writing whenever a real estate broker acting as a salesperson enters the employ of or is terminated by the responsible real estate broker and would make certain nonsubstantive changes. By placing a new requirement on a real estate broker to report to the commissioner regarding the employment or termination of a real estate broker acting as a salesperson, this bill would expand an existing crime.
This bill would incorporate additional changes in Section 10083.2 of the Business and Professions Code, proposed by AB 1807, that would become operative only if AB 1807 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 2, 2017. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to require the office of the commissioner of the Department of Commerce in California to provide on its website information on the status of every license issued by the department and on suspensions and revocations of licenses issued by the department and accusations filed against persons or businesses subject to licensure or regulation by the department. The information must not include personal information, including a home telephone number, date of birth, or social security number. The office must disclose a licensee's address of record, but shall allow a licensee to provide a post office box number or other alternative mailing address as his or her address of record. The office may develop, through regulations, a written justification and evidence of rehabilitation for a licensee's petition to remove an item from the website for no less than 10 years and for which the licensee provides evidence of rehabilitation."
"The Dental Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of dentists and associated professions by the Dental Board of California within the Department of Consumer Affairs. The act requires each applicant for a license to practice dentistry to successfully complete specified examinations, including receiving a passing score on either a portfolio examination, as specified, or a clinical and written examination administered by the Western Regional Examining Board, which determines the passing score for that examination.
This bill would additionally allow an applicant to satisfy that examination requirement by receiving a passing score on the clinical and written examination developed by the American Board of Dental Examiners, Inc., subject to prior review and approval of the examination by the Office of Professional Examination Services, as provided, delivery of this review to the Dental Board of California, and payment of specified expenses incurred by the board.
Existing law authorizes the Director of Finance to accept on behalf of the state any gift of real or personal property whenever he or she deems the gift and the terms and conditions thereof to be in the best interest of the state. Existing law establishes the Special Deposit Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, which consists of money that is paid into it in trust pursuant to law when no other fund has been created to receive that money.
This bill would authorize the Department of Finance to accept funds for the purposes of reviewing and analyzing the dental examination developed by the American Board of Dental Examiners, Inc., described above. Because these funds would be deposited in the Special Deposit Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, this bill would make an appropriation.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 1632 of the Business and Professions Code proposed by SB 1478 that would become operative if this bill and SB 1478 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on June 22, 2010.

"Existing law makes petty theft involving merchandise taken from a merchant’s premises punishable by a fine of not less than $50 and not more than $1,000, and imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding 6 months.
This bill would provide that nothing in that section or any other law precludes a merchant from offering a person suspected of theft an opportunity to complete a precomplaint diversion program in lieu of arrest and criminal prosecution, or informing a person suspected of theft of the criminal civil remedies available to the merchant.
Existing law generally prohibits strip searches and body cavity searches of prearraignment detainees arrested for infraction or misdemeanor offenses. Existing law allows a person who has been arrested and taken into custody to be subjected to patdown searches, metal detector searches, and thorough clothing searches in order to discover and retrieve concealed weapons and contraband substances prior to being placed in a booking cell.

Existing law requires the department to issue a permit if the department determines that the use does not cause any significant effects to fish and wildlife and would authorize the department to adjust the specified fee to an amount sufficient to cover all reasonable costs of the department in regulating suction dredging activities. Existing law authorizes the State Water Resources Control Board or a California regional water quality control board to adopt waste discharge requirements or a waiver of waste discharge requirements that address certain water quality impacts, specify conditions or areas where the discharge of waste or other adverse impacts on beneficial uses of the waters of the state from the use of vacuum or suction dredge equipment is prohibited, or prohibit particular use of, or methods of using, vacuum or suction dredge equipment, or any portion thereof, for the extraction of minerals, that the state board or a regional board determines generally cause or contribute to an exceedance of applicable water quality objectives or unreasonably impact beneficial uses.
This bill would require the state board and the department to report to the Legislature, on or before June 1, 2017, on the status of the suction dredge permitting program.
Under existing law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the State Water Resources Control Board and the California regional water quality control boards are the principal state agencies with responsibility for the coordination and control of water quality in the state. The act, with certain exceptions, requires a waste discharger to file certain information with the appropriate regional board and to pay an annual fee.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.","This bill amends the Water Code, with respect to the waste discharge permit program, to require the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California State Water Resources Control Board to report to the Legislature on the status of the permit program, including at least all of the information concerning: the number or amount of permits issued statewide; the cost of permits and associated fees; the requirements and process for an individual to proceed with obtaining waste discharge requirements or a waiver of waste discharge requirements; and a discussion of the public workshops conducted regarding such requirements and permits. Each person subject to the waste discharge permit program must file with the appropriate regional board a report of waste discharge relative to any material change or proposed change in the character, location, or volume of the discharge. The annual fees collected pursuant to this bill shall equal the amount necessary to recover costs incurred in connection with the issuance, administration, reviewing, monitoring, and enforcement of waste discharge requirements and waivers. Those costs may include, but are not limited to, costs incurred in reviewing waste discharge reports, prescribing terms of waste discharge requirements and monitoring requirements, enforcing and evaluating compliance with waste discharge requirements and monitoring requirements, conducting surface water groundwater monitoring and modeling, analyzing laboratory samples, adopting, reviewing, and revising water quality control plans and state policies for water"
"Existing law prohibits an employer from discharging or in any manner discriminating or retaliating against an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking for taking time off from work for specified purposes related to addressing the domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Existing law provides that any employee who is discharged, threatened with discharge, demoted, suspended, or in any manner discriminated or retaliated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because the employee has taken time off for those purposes is entitled to reinstatement and reimbursement for lost wages and work benefits caused by the acts of the employer, as well as appropriate equitable relief, and is allowed to file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement within the Department of Industrial Relations. Existing law establishes the Labor Commissioner as the head of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement.
This bill would require employers to inform each employee of his or her rights established under those laws by providing specific information in writing to new employees upon hire and to other employees upon request. The bill would also require the Labor Commissioner, on or before July 1, 2017, to develop a form an employer may elect to use to comply with these provisions and to post it on the commissioner’s Internet Web site. Employers would not be required to comply with the notice of rights requirement until the commissioner posts the form.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003.

"Existing law, the Gun-Free School Zone Act of 1995, subject to exceptions, prohibits a person from possessing a firearm in a place that the person knows, or reasonably should know, is a school zone, unless with the written permission of certain school district officials. Existing law defines a school zone as an area on the grounds of a school providing instruction in kindergarten or grades 1 to 12, inclusive, or within a distance of 1,000 feet of that school. Existing law, subject to exceptions, prohibits a person from bringing or possessing a firearm upon the grounds of a campus of a public or private university or college, or buildings owned or operated for student housing, teaching, research, or administration by a public or private university or college, that are contiguous or are clearly marked university property, as specified, unless with the written permission of specified university or college officials. Under existing law, a violation of these provisions is a felony, or, under specified circumstances, a misdemeanor. Under existing law, certain persons are exempt from both the school zone and the university prohibitions, including, among others, a retired peace officer authorized to carry a concealed or loaded firearm.
This bill would exempt from both the school zone and the university prohibitions a person holding a valid license to carry a concealed firearm who is also protected by a domestic violence protective order, as specified.
Existing law, subject to exceptions, prohibits carrying ammunition or reloaded ammunition onto school grounds unless it is with the written permission of the school district superintendent, the superintendent’s designee, or equivalent school authority.
This bill would exempt from that prohibition a person holding a valid license to carry a concealed firearm who is also protected by a domestic violence protective order, as specified. The bill would make additional technical, nonsubstantive changes.","Gun-Free School Zone Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit any person from possessing a firearm in a place that the person knows, or reasonably should know, is a school zone, unless it is with the written permission of the school district superintendent, his or her designee, or equivalent school authority, and such prohibition does not apply: (1) within a place of residence or place of business or on private property, if such place is not part of the school grounds and the possession of the firearm is otherwise lawful; (2) when the firearm is an unloaded pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on the person and is in a locked container or within the locked trunk of a motor vehicle; (3) when the person possessing the firearm reasonably believes that he or she is in grave danger because of circumstances forming the basis of a current restraining order issued by a court against another person or persons who has been found to pose a threat to his or her life or safety; and (4) when the person is exempt from the prohibition against carrying a concealed firearm pursuant to specified Federal provisions, when the person holds a valid license to carry the firearm, who is carrying the firearm in an area that is not in, or on the grounds of, a public or private school providing"
"Existing law specifies the number of judges for the superior court of each county. Existing law allocates additional judgeships to the various counties in accordance with uniform standards for factually determining additional judicial need in each county, as updated and approved by the Judicial Council, pursuant to the Update of Judicial Needs Study, based on specified criteria, including, among others, workload standards that represent the average amount of time of bench and nonbench work required to resolve each case type.
This bill would require the allocation of up to 5 vacant judgeships, as defined, from superior courts with more authorized judgeships than their assessed judicial need to superior courts with fewer authorized judgeships than their assessed judicial need. The bill would require the allocation to be in accordance with a methodology approved by the Judicial Council, as specified, and would require the determination of a superior court’s assessed judicial need to be in accordance with the above uniform standards and be based on the criteria described above. The bill would require the Judicial Council, if a vacant judgeship is eligible for allocation to another superior court, to promptly notify the applicable courts, the Legislature, and the Governor that the judgeship shall be allocated to another court.
This bill would also make a statement of legislative intent regarding the authority of the Legislature, the Governor, and the Chief Justice of California.
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health facilities by the State Department of Public Health and prohibits a health facility from providing a special service without the approval of the department. Under existing law, a violation of these provisions is a crime. Existing law defines a “special service” to mean a functional division, department, or unit of a health facility that is organized, staffed, and equipped to provide a specific type of patient care and that has been identified by regulations of the department and for which the department has established special standards for quality of care. Under existing law, “special services” includes physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, or speech pathology and audiology services provided by a nursing facility to outpatients.
This bill would additionally define “special services” to mean dialysis, peritoneal, and infusion services as may be approved by the department for nursing facilities and skilled nursing facilities that are not identified in regulations of the department, if the licensee can demonstrate to the department that the special service will operate in accordance with a minimum standard for quality of care. The bill would require a licensee applying to the department for approval of special services that are not identified by regulations of the department to submit an application and other information, as specified. By expanding the application of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(Sec. 2) States that it is the intent of the Legislature that this Act shall not be construed to limit any of the following: (1) the authority of the Legislature to create and fund new judgeships pursuant to Section 4 of the California Constitution; (2) the authority of the Governor to appoint a person to fill a vacancy pursuant to Section 16 of such Constitution; and (3) the authority of the Chief Justice of California to assign judges pursuant to Section 6 of such Constitution.<n>(Sec. 3) Provides that, to provide for a more equitable distribution of judgeships, up to five vacant judgeships shall be allocated from superior courts with more authorized judgeships than their assessed judicial need to superior courts with fewer authorized judgeships than their assessed judicial need pursuant to this Act.<n>Specifies that the allocation of vacant judgeships shall be in accordance with a methodology approved by the Judicial Council after solicitation of public comments.

"Existing law authorizes the State Water Resources Control Board to adopt regulations requiring measurement and reporting of water diversion and use by persons including, among others, those authorized to appropriate water under a permit, license, registration for small domestic, small irrigation, or livestock stockpond use, or a certification for livestock stockpond use.
This bill would restrict the state board’s authorization to adopt regulations requiring measurement and reporting of water diversion and use by persons authorized to appropriate water under a registration or certification to uses that are year-round.
Existing law requires a person who diverts 10 acre-feet of water per year or more under a permit or license to install and maintain a device or employ a method capable of measuring the rate of direct diversion, rate of collection to storage, and rate of withdrawal or release from storage, as specified, and with certain exceptions.

"Existing law, the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act, regulates the creation and governance of common interest developments, which are managed by associations. Existing law generally provides that an association is responsible for maintaining common areas in the development and owners of separate interests are responsible for their interests. Existing law permits an association to require the removal of an occupant of a separate interest for those times and periods as may be necessary for the effective treatment of wood-destroying pests. Existing law generally requires a landlord or his or her authorized agent to provide notice to tenants, and under certain circumstances tenants of adjacent units, of the use of pesticides at the tenant’s dwelling unit or in common areas if the landlord or authorized agent applies any pesticide without a licensed pest control operator.
This bill would require a common interest development association or its authorized agent to provide notice to an owner and, if applicable, a tenant of a separate interest, and under certain circumstances to owners and, if applicable, tenants of adjacent separate interests, if pesticide is to be applied without a licensed pest control operator to a separate interest or to a common area. The bill would prescribe the contents of the notice and how it is to be provided. The bill would authorize an owner or tenant to agree to immediate pesticide application and would prescribe a revised notification procedure in this instance. The bill would also permit the notice to be posted, as specified, after the pesticide application if the pest poses an imminent threat to health and safety.","Declares the intent of this bill that when pesticides are about to be applied to the separate interests or to the common areas of a common interest development either by a homeowner association or by one of its agents rather than by a licensed pest control operator, that the owners and, if applicable, tenants of the separate interests and the owners and, if applicable, tenants of adjacent separate units that could reasonably be impacted by the pesticide be provided with substantially the same written notification that they would have received under existing law had pesticides been applied by a licensed pest control operator. Requires: (1) an association or its authorized agent that applies any pesticide to a separate interest or to the common area without a licensed pest control operator to provide the owner and, if applicable, the tenant of an affected separate interest, with written notice that contains specified statements and information using words with common and everyday meaning, including the name and brand of the pesticide product proposed to be used; and (2) such association or agent, if applicable, to provide individual notice to the owner and tenant of the separate interest that is adjacent to the common area."
"The Child Care and Development Services Act has a purpose of providing a comprehensive, coordinated, and cost-effective system of child care and development services for children from infancy to 13 years of age and their parents, including a full range of supervision, health, and support services through full- and part-time programs. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to develop standards for the implementation of quality child care programs. Existing law authorizes the County of Alameda, as a pilot project, to develop an individualized county child care subsidy plan, as provided.
This bill would authorize, until January 1, 2022, the County of Santa Clara to develop and implement an individualized county child care subsidy plan, as specified. The bill would require the plan to be submitted to the local planning council and the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors for approval, as specified. The bill would require the Early Education and Support Division of the State Department of Education to review and approve or disapprove the plan and any subsequent modifications to the plan. The bill would require the County of Santa Clara to annually prepare and submit to the Legislature, the State Department of Social Services, and the State Department of Education a report that contains specified information relating to the success of the county’s plan.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Santa Clara.","(Sec. 2) This bill authorizes Santa Clara County to develop and implement an individualized county child care subsidy plan to ensure that child care received by the county are supported by a system that provides access to affordable, high-quality services, integrated data systems, and a strong infrastructure that supports children and the educators that serve them. The plan must: (1) identify county goals for its subsidized child care system; (2) identify barriers in the state and regional markets that inhibit meeting the goals; and (3) ensure that child care received by the county are supported by a system that provides access to affordable, high-quality services, integrated data systems, and a strong infrastructure that supports children and the educators that serve them."
"Under existing law, taxpayers are allowed to contribute amounts in excess of their personal income tax liability for the support of various funds. Existing law also contains administrative provisions that are generally applicable to voluntary contributions.
This bill would allow a taxpayer to designate an amount in excess of personal income tax liability to be deposited to the Special Olympics Fund, which the bill would create. The bill would require moneys transferred to the Special Olympics Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller, as provided, and to the State Department of Social Services for disbursement to the Special Olympics Northern California and the Special Olympics Southern California for the purpose of funding activities of the Special Olympics in support of children and adults with intellectual disabilities, as provided. The bill would authorize the State Department of Social Services to use up to 3% of the moneys allocated to it for administrative costs. The bill would require the Special Olympics Northern California and the Special Olympics Southern California to annually provide a report to the State Department of Social Services regarding the expenditure of the moneys disbursed to each organization, as specified.","Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to allow individuals to designate on their tax returns a contribution in excess of the tax liability, if any, to the Special Olympics Fund to be used by the Special Olympics Northern California and Special Olympics Southern California.

"The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (CERL) establishes retirement plans, known as Retirement Plan D and Retirement Plan E, that are applicable in the retirement system in Los Angeles County and prescribes procedures for members to transfer between those plans. CERL defines “Retirement Plan E” to mean the noncontributory retirement plan established by specific provisions, and defines “Retirement Plan D” to mean the contributory retirement plan otherwise available to new members of the retirement system on the transfer date.
This bill would revise the definition of Retirement Plan D to, instead, refer to the contributory retirement plan otherwise available to members of the system between June 1, 1979, and December 31, 2012, inclusive.
CERL provides for the retirement system in Los Angeles County specific ages and pension allowances for normal and early retirement. Under CERL, a member of a CERL retirement system who is eligible to retire at 50 years of age pursuant to specified statute, or who is required to retire because of age while a member of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS), a CERL retirement system in another county, the State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS), or a retirement system of any other public agency of the state that has established reciprocity with PERS subject to certain conditions, but who cannot retire concurrently from PERS, a CERL retirement system in another county, STRS, or a retirement system of any other public agency of the state that has established reciprocity with PERS subject to certain conditions, is entitled to have final compensation and service determined under specific statutes as if the member had retired concurrently under that other system (concurrent retirement exception). Provisions of CERL specifically applicable to Los Angeles County, among other things, apply reciprocal benefits, including the concurrent retirement exception, to the retirement system in Los Angeles County.
This bill would amend provisions of CERL specifically applicable to Los Angeles County to provide that the concurrent retirement exception applies to a member of the retirement system in Los Angeles County eligible to retire at 55 years of age and would state that the amendment is declaratory of existing law.
CERL sets forth the membership composition for boards of retirement, as specified. Under that law, the retirement board in specified counties is comprised of 9 members and an alternate member, as specified. That law also authorizes specified counties to appoint an alternate retired member to the office of the 8th member of the board and authorizes the alternate retired member to vote as a member of the board only in the event the 8th member is absent from a board meeting for any cause.
This bill would additionally authorize the alternate retired member to vote as a member of the board if the 8th member is present and both the 2nd and 3rd, both the 2nd and 7th, or both the 3rd and 7th members are absent for any cause.
Under CERL, except as specified, the management of a retirement system is vested in the board of retirement. CERL authorizes such a board to make regulations not inconsistent with that law, and requires that the regulations include specific provisions, including provisions for the filing of a sworn statement by every person who is or becomes a member, showing date of birth, nature and duration of employment with the county, compensation received, and other information as is required by the board.
This bill would authorize those regulations, in lieu of a sworn statement, to provide for the submission by a member’s employer to the retirement association of the information otherwise required in a sworn statement, in a form determined by the retirement association.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2010.

The bill would establish the Autism Employment and Education Fund in the State Treasury and allocate moneys in the fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the board of governors and the trustees for the development, implementation, and administration of the program. The bill would only become operative upon appropriation by the Legislature for the implementation and administration of the program.","This bill establishes the Autism Employment and Education Program at each participating community college and California State University campus to help students with mental disabilities, including autism, live independently, obtain employment, and become otherwise self-sufficient after they graduate or withdraw from the campus.

"Existing law, the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MCRSA), provides for the licensure and regulation of medical cannabis and requires all commercial cannabis activity to be conducted between licensees. Existing law establishes the Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation within the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law authorizes licensing authorities to only issue state licenses to qualified applicants. Existing law, upon the date of implementation of regulations by the licensing authority, prohibits a person from engaging in commercial cannabis activity without possessing both a state license and a local permit, license, or other authorization.
This bill would instead prohibit a person from engaging in commercial cannabis activity without possessing both a state license and a local permit, license, or other authorization one year after the bureau posts a notice on its Internet Web site that the licensing authorities have commenced issuing licenses. The bill would also, with regard to commercial cannabis activity in the City of Los Angeles, prohibit licensing authorities from requiring a local license, permit, or other authorization, and would require the issuance of a state license, if the authorities determine, as specified, that the applicant meets all of the requirements of MCRSA and specified criteria relating to Measure D, which was approved by the voters of the City of Los Angeles at the May 21, 2013, general election. The bill would further provide that a license issued pursuant to the above provision has the same force and effect, and confers the same benefits and responsibilities, as licenses issued to licensees not subject to the above-described exception. The bill would require the exemption to the local licensing requirement provided by these provisions to be superseded by a subsequent initiative authorizing the City of Los Angeles to issue local licenses to medical marijuana businesses in the city if the voters of Los Angeles approve the initiative prior to the time the State of California begins issuing state licenses.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on October 23, 2015.

This bill would require the Governor to appoint a permanent nonfaculty employee of the university as one of the 16 appointive members of the board, as specified. The bill would require a systemwide staff council, as specified, to provide to the Governor a list of 2 nominees for the Governor’s consideration, and would require the Governor to appoint one of the nominees to fill a vacancy in an appointive position on the board.

"Existing law, the Housing Authorities Law, declares that providing safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income is a public use and purpose for which public money may be spent and private property acquired, and is a governmental function of state concern. Existing law establishes procedures by which a local government may create or authorize a local housing authority to operate within it for this purpose. Existing law authorizes those housing authorities to convey surplus lands, as specified, for the development of homes for ownership by persons and families of low or moderate income. Existing law requires every local housing authority within a county or city to file on the first day of October of each year with the Department of Housing and Community Development a complete report of its activities during the previous fiscal year, with specified recommendations.
This bill would require the department, in conjunction with the California Housing Finance Agency to report, no later than January 1, 2018, on ways to increase homeownership for extremely low, very low, and low-income households. The bill would require the department and the agency to carry out and include in the report a survey of housing authorities in California, as specified.
Existing law declares the intent of the Legislature to preserve, upgrade, and expand the supply of housing to persons and families of low or moderate income, through the sale of specified surplus residential property owned by public agencies. Existing law establishes priorities and procedures that any state agency disposing of that surplus residential property is required to follow.
This bill, on or before January 1, 2018, would require every local government agency, as defined, to adopt a mortgage program that, among other things, allocates 10% of all single-family residences that the local government agency owns and leases to become eligible for purchase by tenants presently occupying the single–family residence. The bill would require each local government agency to adopt regulations for the administration of the program that include, among other things, eligibility requirements that limit the program to use by persons with extremely low income households, very low income households, lower income households, or persons and families of low or moderate income. By imposing new duties on local government agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill amends the Health and Safety Code to require the Department of Housing and Community Development, in conjunction with the California Housing Finance Agency, to report to Congress on ways to increase homeownership for extremely low, very low, and low-income households.

establish the 9-member Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education, and specify its membership and duties. The bill would require the commission to publish a report on designated subjects and submit this report to designated governmental entities by March 31, 2018. The bill would require the Office of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education to close on June 30, 2018, and would repeal the provisions of the bill on January 1, 2019. The bill would require, upon that repeal, all of the documents and working papers of the commission to become the property of the State Archives.","This bill creates the Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education to make recommendations to the Student Aid Commission, the Department of Finance, and other state agencies on improving access to and affordability in postsecondary education for all Californians. The commission shall include outreach groups from low-income and working class communities, ethnic groups from the latter groups, and historically disadvantaged groups."
"The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect. CEQA also requires a lead agency to prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project that may have a significant effect on the environment if revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate that effect and there is no substantial evidence that the project, as revised, would have a significant effect on the environment. CEQA exempts specified pipeline projects from the above requirements.
This bill would, until January 1, 2020, additionally exempt from CEQA a project for the construction and installation of a new pipeline or the maintenance, repair, restoration, reconditioning, relocation, replacement, removal, or demolition of an existing pipeline, not exceeding 8 miles in length, for the distribution of recycled water within a public street, highway, or right-of-way and would require the lead agency to undertake specified activities, including the filing of a notice of exemption for the project with the Office of Planning and Research and the office of the county clerk of each county in which the project is located. The bill would require the lead agency, before determining the applicability of the exemption, to hold a noticed public hearing to consider and adopt mitigation measures for potential traffic impacts of the project. Because the lead agency would be required to determine whether a project qualifies for that exemption, and undertake specified activities, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the county clerk to post the notice of exemption within 24 hours of receipt, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Declares that the state of California is experiencing its worst water crisis in modern history increasing the use of recycled water and should, while still complying with all state and local laws and providing notice to the public and appropriate local and state agencies, apply such provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act to a project of less than eight miles in length within a public street, highway, or right-of-way for new municipal recycled water pipeline construction and installation, subject to specified requirements. Excludes from such provision any project that is located within 20 days of receipt of notice from the Office of Planning and Research and in office within 24 hours of receipt of permission for the overlaying property adjacent to another recycled water pipeline, for which the applicant has given permission to the overlaying property subject to the right-of-way over private property, in the case of a right-of-way over private property until January 1, 2020. Requires the office to: (1) ensure, negotiate, hold public hearings on, and adopt mitigation measures for a project for which the applicant has given permission to the overlaying property adjacent to an existing recycled water pipeline, or for which the project is located in a conservation area; and (2) ensure that the overlaying property remains in effect until the earlier of January 1, 2020, or"
"Existing law, among several affordable housing programs, establishes the Local Housing Trust Fund Matching Grant Program, administered by the Department of Housing and Community Development, for the purpose of supporting local housing trust funds dedicated to the creation or preservation of affordable housing. Existing law authorizes the department to make matching grants available to cities and counties, or a city and county, and existing charitable nonprofit organizations that have created, funded, and operated housing trust funds.
This bill would create the Workforce Housing Pilot Program, pursuant to which the department, subject to the appropriation of funds for that purpose, would award grant funding to eligible recipients, as defined, for the predevelopment costs, acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of rental housing projects or units within rental housing projects that serve, and for providing downpayment assistance to, persons and families of low or moderate income. The bill would require all grant funds to be matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis, unless the eligible recipient is suffering a hardship and is unable to generate the matching funds.
The bill would require the Department of Finance to determine whether an eligible recipient is suffering a hardship.
The bill would require the
department,
Department of Housing and Community Development,
on or before December 31 of each year in which grant funds are awarded, to provide a report to the Legislature regarding the number of grants awarded, a description of the projects funded, the number of units funded, and the amount of matching funds received. The bill would require the pilot program to operate until all appropriated funds have been awarded. The bill, upon the depletion of appropriated funds, would require the department to submit a report to the Assembly and Senate committees on appropriations evaluating the need for housing of persons and families of low or moderate income in areas that received grant funds and a recommendation on whether the pilot program should continue.","Establishes the Workforce Housing Pilot Program under which the Department of Housing and Community Development shall award grant funding to eligible recipients, through the issuance of a notice of funding availability, for predevelopment costs, acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of rental housing projects or units within rental housing projects that serve persons and families of low or moderate income. Directs that: (1) an eligible recipient use such funds to provide downpayment assistance to persons and families of low or moderate income; and (2) the program operate until all appropriated funds have been awarded."
"(1) Existing law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, within 30 days of any action or failure to act by a California regional water quality control board under specified law, authorizes an aggrieved person to petition the State Water Resources Control Board to review that action or failure to act. Existing law authorizes the state board, in the case of such a review, upon notice and hearing, if a hearing is requested, to stay in whole or in part the effect of the decision and order of a regional board or of the state board.
This bill would expand that provision to authorize the state board to issue a stay in the case of review by the state board of a decision or order issued under authority delegated to an officer or employee of the state board where the state board by regulation has authorized a petition for reconsideration by the state board. The bill would generally require the state board to issue or deny the stay within 90 days of receipt of a request for stay, as specified, and would deem the request for stay denied if the state board fails to issue or deny the stay within the prescribed applicable period. The bill would authorize any aggrieved party, within 30 days of any order of the state board issuing or denying a stay or within 30 days of a stay being deemed denied, to file with the superior court a petition for writ of mandate and would specify the law that governs those proceedings.
The act authorizes an aggrieved party to file with the superior court a petition for writ of mandate for review of a decision or order issued by the state board or a regional board, and requires those proceedings to be governed by specified law. Existing law, except as specified, requires the court to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence in cases involving the judicial review of a decision or order of the state board, or a decision or order of a regional board for which the state board denies review under the act.
This bill would require the state board to order or deny reconsideration on a petition not later than 90 days from the date the state board adopts the decision or order. The bill, except as specified, would prohibit any legal or equitable process from issuing in any proceeding in any court against the state board, a regional board, or any officer or employee of the state board or a regional board to review, prevent, or enjoin any adjudicative proceeding under the act, or a decision or order by the state board, a regional board, or any officer or employee of the state board or a regional board before a decision or order is issued and the procedures for administrative review of that decision or order have been exhausted.
(2) Existing law, the California Safe Drinking Water Act, requires the state board to administer provisions relating to the regulation of drinking water to protect public health. The state board’s duties include, but are not limited to, conducting research, studies, and demonstration programs relating to the provision of a dependable, safe supply of drinking water, enforcing the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, and adopting and enforcing regulations. Existing law requires the state board to appoint a deputy director to oversee the issuance and enforcement of public water system permits and delegates certain authorities of the state board to the deputy director. The act authorizes the deputy director to issue an order directing certain actions whenever the deputy director determines that a person has violated or is violating the act, or any permit, regulation, or standard issued or adopted pursuant to the act. The act authorizes an aggrieved party 30 days after service of a copy of the order or decision to file with the superior court a petition for a writ of mandate for review of the order or decision. The act requires that the evidence before the court consist of all relevant evidence that, in the judgment of the court, should be considered to effectuate and implement the act and requires, in every case, the court to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence. The act prohibits a failure to file an action from precluding a party from challenging the reasonableness and validity of the decision or order in specified judicial proceedings.
This bill would provide that a decision or order of the state board is not subject to review by any court if no aggrieved party petitions for a writ of mandate within 30 days after service of a copy of an order or decision issued by the state board. The bill would eliminate the requirement that the evidence before the court consist of all relevant evidence that, in the judgment of the court, should be considered to effectuate and implement the act.","Amends the Health and Safety Act of 1978 to permit an aggrieved party to file with the superior court a petition for a writ of mandate for review of a decision or order issued by the California State Water Resources Board. Declares that in every case, the court shall exercise its independent judgment on the evidence. <n>(Sec. 2) Amends the Water Code to allow the State board, upon notice and hearing, to stay in whole or in part the effect of a decision or order of a regional board or of the State board with respect to water quality certifications: (1) issued for a discharge of water from a hydroelectric facility associated with a hydroelectric facility and the proposed activity requires a license or amendment to a license issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; or (2) that requires the provision of alternate water supplies within 120 days of the date of the order. <n>(Sec. 3) Provides that if the State board fails to issue or deny the stay within the applicable period, the request for stay shall be deemed denied on the first day following such period. Permits an aggrieved party to file with the superior court a petition for writ of mandate for review of a State board decision or order. Provides that if the superior court finds that the State board failed to follow the procedures specified in"
"Existing law establishes the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program, under which each county provides cash assistance and other benefits to qualified low-income families using federal, state, and county funds. Existing law establishes a 48-month lifetime limit of CalWORKs benefits for eligible adults, as specified. Existing law requires a recipient of CalWORKs to participate in certain welfare-to-work activities as a condition of eligibility for 24 cumulative months, as specified, and to meet other federal requirements, as specified. Existing law provides that participation in certain activities is not counted against that 24-month period. Existing law requires the county to assign a CalWORKs recipient who lacks a high school diploma or its equivalent to participate in adult basic education, if the recipient has completed job search activities but did not find employment and the education is needed to become employed. Existing law also requires, in order for a recipient to engage in adult basic education in satisfaction of welfare-to-work requirements, the county to perform an assessment and develop a welfare-to-work plan that includes participation in the educational activity.
This bill would instead provide that if the county determines that a CalWORKs recipient has not received his or her high school diploma or its equivalent, the recipient may participate in a high school equivalency program in order to complete a high school equivalency test recognized by the State Department of Education, and that a specified amount of time participating in that activity would not count against the 24-month period described above for certain recipients. The bill would authorize a recipient to participate in a high school equivalency program in lieu of participating in a job search or job club, as specified, and would prohibit a county from requiring the recipient to participate in an assessment before the recipient may engage in a high school equivalency program in satisfaction of welfare-to-work requirements.","This bill amends the Welfare and Institutions Code, with respect to the requirements for the welfare-to-work program, to require recipients to participate in: (1) job search and job club; (2) family stabilization; (3) a high school equivalency program; (4) substance abuse, mental health, or domestic violence services; and (5) assessment. Following assessment, the county and the recipient shall develop a welfare-to-work plan, which shall specify the activities to be provided for and supportive services to be provided. A recipient who has signed a plan shall participate in work activities. Welfare-to-work activities may include: (1) unsubsidized private sector employment; (2) subsidized public sector employment; (3) work experience that helps provide basic job skills, enhance existing job skills in a position related to the participant, or provide a needed community service that will lead to employment; and (4) grant-based on-the-job training."
"Existing law provides for the issuance of bail licenses under the jurisdiction of the Insurance Commissioner for bail agents, bail permittees, and bail solicitors. Existing law requires persons soliciting or negotiating the execution or delivery of an undertaking of bail on behalf of a surety insurer to be licensed as a bail agent. Existing law requires the commissioner to charge and collect specified fees for an application for a new or renewed bail license by a bail agent, bail permittee, or bail solicitor.
This bill would increase the fees for an application for a new or renewed bail license, as specified. The bill would require each surety insurer or bail permittee to pay a fee, not to exceed $10 per bail bond transaction. These fees would go to the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund, created as a special account in the Insurance Fund. The bill would provide that moneys in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund be distributed by the commissioner, upon appropriation, to fund the reasonable costs incurred in regulating entities involved in the undertaking of bail, as specified. The bill would provide that if the total amount in the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund ever exceeds $8,000,000, then the commissioner shall reduce the amount of the assessment, as specified. The bill would authorize the commissioner to develop guidelines to implement or clarify these provisions. The bill would require the commissioner to provide an annual report on the department’s Internet Web site including various information, as specified. The bill would make related legislative findings and declarations.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.","Directs the commissioner of the Department of Insurance to charge and collect specified fees for: (1) filing an application or request for a bail agent's license; (2) filing an application for examination, or re-examination, for a bail permittees renewal application; (3) filing an application for an examination, or re-examination, if a qualifying examination is required for issue or in connection with the license; and (4) filing the first application to take the qualifying examination. Prescribes fees for: (1) filing an application or request for approval of a bail solicitor's license; and (2) filing a bond required by this Act."
"Existing law establishes the State 911 Advisory
Board
Board
,
which is composed of 11 members who meet quarterly in public sessions and are appointed by, and serve at the pleasure
of
of,
the Governor.
This bill would increase the membership to 13 members, as specified.
This bill would also prohibit a representative from the California Emergency Medical Services
Authority, communications industry, cellular technology
or
with a background in the
telecommunications
industry, or public safety communications field
industry
from being a member of the board if, during the 2 years prior to appointment on the board, he or she received a substantial portion of his or her income from a listed professional category or industry.
Existing law, the Political Reform Act of 1974, generally prohibits a public official at any level of state or local government from making, participating in making, or in any way attempting to use his or her official position to influence a governmental decision in which he or she knows, or has reason to know, he or she has a financial interest.
This bill would prohibit a member of the advisory board from personally and substantially participating, as specified, in a claim, contract, controversy, determination, plan, study, or other matter in which the advisory board is a party or has an interest, if the member of the advisory board has knowledge that he or she, his or her spouse, minor child, or partner, or an organization, as specified, for which the member of the advisory board currently serves as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee or has served in this position within the 2 year period prior to his or her appointment to the advisory board has a direct or indirect financial interest in the matter.
This bill would prohibit a member of the advisory board from acting as an agent, attorney, or employee for any party other than the state when the advisory board is a party to or has a direct, substantial interest in a judicial or other proceeding, hearing, application, request for a ruling, or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, study, plan, or other particular matter.
This bill would also prohibit a representative from the California Emergency Medical Services
Authority, communications industry, cellular technology or telecommunications industry, or public safety communications field
Authority or with a background in the telecommunications industry

The summary of that version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) Amends the Government Code to establish in California the State 911 Advisory Board, which shall: (1) advise the Governor on the state's 911 system; (2) provide recommendations to the Governor on 911 system improvements; and (3) consult with other state agencies, organizations, and individuals regarding the 911 system. Specifies board members to have at least two years of experience as a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) manager or county coordinator or with a background in the telecommunications industry, except where a specific person is designated as a member.

"Existing law makes it the duty of a coroner to inquire into and determine the circumstances, manner, and cause of deaths under prescribed conditions, including deaths under such circumstances as to afford a reasonable ground to suspect that the death was caused by the criminal act of another. Existing law provides for the execution of a certificate of religious belief stating that postmortem anatomical dissection or specified procedures would violate the religious convictions of the person, and, except as specified, prohibits a coroner from performing the procedure. Existing law requires a postmortem examination or autopsy to include certain procedures, including, among others, taking available fingerprints and palm prints and a dental examination including dental charts and dental X-rays, as specified. Existing law authorizes the postmortem examination or autopsy of the unidentified body or remains to include full body X-rays.
This bill, except as specified, would authorize a coroner, medical examiner, or other agency required to perform an autopsy in a death under those prescribed conditions to use an electronic image system, including, but not limited to, an X-ray computed tomography scanning system, to fulfill specified postmortem examination or autopsy requirements. The bill would prohibit a coroner, medical examiner, or other agency performing an autopsy in a death under those prescribed conditions from using an electronic image system to conduct the autopsy in any investigation where the circumstances surrounding the death afford a reasonable basis to suspect that the death was caused by or related to the criminal act of another and it is necessary to collect evidence for presentation in a court of law. The bill would require a dissection autopsy to be performed to determine the cause and manner of death if the results of an autopsy performed using electronic imaging provides the basis to suspect that the death was caused by or related to the criminal act of another and it is necessary to collect evidence for presentation in a court of law. The bill would allow an autopsy to be conducted using an X-ray computed tomography scanning system without regard to the existence of a properly-executed certificate of religious belief.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that a postmortem examination or autopsy conducted at the discretion of a coroner, medical examiner, or other agency upon an unidentified body or human remains shall include the following procedures: (1) taking of all available fingerprints and prints; (2) a dental examination consisting of dental charts and dental X-rays of the deceased person's teeth, which may be conducted on the body or human remains by a qualified dentist; (3) the collection of tissue, including a hair sample, or body fluid samples for future DNA testing; (4) frontal and lateral facial photographs with the scale indicated; (5) notation and photographs, with a scale, of significant scars, marks, marks on clothing items, or other personal effects found with or near the body remains; (6) observations of the location of the unidentified body remains; and (7) the postmortem examination or autopsy of the unidentified body remains may include full body X-rays.

"The Solar Water Heating and Efficiency Act of 2007, until August 1, 2017, requires the Public Utilities Commission, if it determines that a solar water heating program is cost effective for ratepayers and in the public interest, to implement a program to promote the installation of 200,000 solar water heating systems in homes, businesses, and buildings or facilities of eligible customer classes receiving natural gas service throughout the state by 2017. The act establishes the maximum funding for the program, for the collective service territories of all gas corporations, at $250,000,000. The act, until August 1, 2017, requires the governing body of each publicly owned utility providing gas service to retail end-use customers to adopt, implement, and finance a solar water heating system incentive program to encourage the installation of 200,000 solar water heating systems by 2017.
This bill would revise the program to, among other things, promote the installation of solar thermal systems throughout the state, set the maximum funding for the program between January 1, 2017, and July 31, 2022, at $250,000,000, reserve 50% of the total program budget for the installation of solar thermal systems in low-income residential housing or in buildings in disadvantaged communities, and extend the operation of the program through July 31, 2022. Because a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission implementing these revisions would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also require the governing body of each publicly owned utility providing gas service, until August 1, 2022, to adopt, implement, and finance a solar thermal system incentive program. Because the bill would extend the obligations of a publicly owned electric utility to adopt, implement, and finance the program, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 16, 2010. The summary of that version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Public Utilities Code to repeal California's authority to impose a surcharge on natural gas distributors and customers to finance solar thermal systems that generate energy from the sun, sell the energy to the distributors, and deliver the energy to the customers. The surcharge applies to solar thermal systems that include multifamily residential, industrial, educational, and nonprofit solar pool heating systems, but does not include single-family residential. The bill also revises and reauthorizes through FY2020 the California New Solar Homes Partnership program, which encourages solar energy systems in new home construction. The program must: (1) ensure that at least 20% of the total units sold or rented to lower income households are already subject to a deed restriction or affordability covenant with a public entity that ensures that the units will be available at an affordable housing cost meeting specified requirements or at an affordable rent meeting specified requirements for a period of not less than 30 years; and (2) include as a purpose of the program to reduce demand for natural gas or electricity through water heating, space heating or cooling, or other methods of capturing heat energy from the sun to reduce natural gas or"
"The Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 authorizes an aggrieved employee to bring a civil action to recover specified civil penalties that would otherwise be assessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency on behalf of the employee and other current or former employees for the violation of certain provisions affecting employees. The act requires the employee to follow specified procedures before bringing an action.
This bill would limit the violations for which an aggrieved employee is authorized to bring a civil action under the act and would require the employee to follow specified procedures before bringing an action.","Amends the Labor Code to allow aggrieved employees to recover civil penalties for certain labor violations through civil actions brought against the Labor and Workplace Development Agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, provided that the court awards a lesser amount than the maximum specified civil penalty if the case would otherwise result in an award unjust, arbitrary, and oppressive, or confatory. Establishes a specified civil penalty for each violation: (1) if the person does not employ one or more employees at the time of the alleged violation; (2) if at the time of the alleged violation, the person employs one or more employees; and (3) if the alleged violation is a failure to act by the Agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees. Entitles any employee who prevails in any action to an award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs. Prohibits any action from being brought by an aggrieved employee if the Agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, on the same facts and theories, cites a person within the timeframes set forth in the Labor Code under which the aggrieved employee is attempting to recover a civil penalty on behalf of himself or herself or other current or former"

For other violations, the act requires the employee to follow specified procedures before bringing an action.
This bill would provide the employer with the right to cure any violation of the Labor Code covered by the act before the employee may bring a civil action. That right to cure would be provided before, and in addition to, any other specified procedures the employee is required to follow prior to bringing an action.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003.

The act authorizes a court, in an action by an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty, as specified, to award a lesser amount than the maximum civil penalty if that penalty would be unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.
This bill would establish a cap on that penalty of $1,000 for each aggrieved employee.","Amends the Labor Code to allow an aggrieved employee to recover a civil penalty for any labor violation through a civil action brought against the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees."

The act also authorizes a court, in any action by an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty, to award a lesser amount than the maximum civil penalty amount specified by the act if, based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case, to do otherwise would result in an award that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.
This bill would authorize a court to dismiss an action as to an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty, if, after notice and hearing, the court finds that the aggrieved employee suffered no appreciable physical or economic harm.","Amends the Labor Code to allow aggrieved employees to recover through a civil action against the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, the maximum civil penalty specified under the code for minimum wage and maximum hour violations.

"The California Constitution requires the Legislature to provide for the disqualification of electors while mentally incompetent or imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony. Existing law provides that a person is entitled to register to vote if he or she is a United States citizen, a resident of California, not imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony, and at least 18 years of age at the time of the next election.
This bill, for purposes of determining who is entitled to register to vote, would define imprisoned as currently serving a state or federal prison sentence and would define parole as a term of supervision by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The bill would clarify that conviction does not include a juvenile adjudication.
Existing law requires any program adopted by a county pursuant to certain provisions that is designed to encourage the registration of electors, with respect to any printed literature or media announcements made in connection with the program, to contain a statement that a person entitled to register to vote must be a United States citizen, a California resident, not in prison or on parole for conviction of a felony, and at least 18 years of age at the time of the election.
This bill would instead require that the statement, as described above, state that a person entitled to register to vote must be a United States citizen, a California resident, not currently in state or federal prison or on state parole for the conviction of a felony, and at least 18 years of age at the time of the election. By requiring a county to change the statement included as part of its voter registration program, as described above, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires the clerk of the superior court of each county, on the basis of the records of the court, to furnish to the chief elections official of the county, at least on April 1 and September 1 of each year, a statement showing the names, addresses, and dates of birth of all persons who have been convicted of felonies since the clerk’s last report. Existing law requires the elections official to cancel the affidavits of registration of those persons who are currently imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony.

The bill would also require each covered hospital or medical entity with 100 or more employees to annually report compensation information by employee classification and by gender, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, and gender identity, as self-reported by its employees. The bill would require specified information to be included in these reports, and would require that certain reports be attested to under penalty of perjury. Because a violation thereof would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would authorize the office to impose a reasonable fee to cover the costs of implementation and administration of these provisions. The bill would require the office to post these reports on its Internet Web site.

"The Public Employees’ Retirement Law authorizes a public agency to participate in, and make all or part of its employees members of, the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) by a contract entered into between its governing body and the board of administration of the system. The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA) requires a public retirement system, as defined, to modify its plan or plans to comply with the act and, among other provisions, establishes new retirement formulas for employees first hired on or after January 1, 2013, as specified.
This bill would authorize a public agency that has contracted with the board of administration of PERS to offer an alternative formula from that required by PEPRA, to be applicable to miscellaneous, nonsafety employees hired after January 1, 2017,
and who are new members, as defined,
if specified contingencies are satisfied, including that the agency and representative employee organization have agreed to its application in a valid memorandum of understanding.
The bill would require that miscellaneous, nonsafety employees who are not new members, as defined, if they are employed by a public employer that did not contract with PERS prior to December 31, 2012, be covered by the default benefit formula under PEPRA. The bill would specify what is pensionable compensation for these purposes.",This bill amends the Government Accountability Office and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to modify the formula that is used by the Public Employees Retirement System (FERS) and the State Teachers Retirement System (STR) in California for calculating the retirement benefits for new nonsafety members. The bill increases the age at which a member may retire from FERS and revises the formula for FERS nonsafety members.

Existing law establishes the Dental Corps Loan Repayment Program of 2002 to assist dentists who practice in an underserved area with loan repayment pursuant to an agreement between the board and the dentist, as specified. Existing law governs eligibility, application, selection, placement, and repayment for the program, and authorizes the board to adopt standards to implement the program relating to eligibility, placement, and termination. Existing law creates the Dentally Underserved Account within the State Dentistry Fund and moneys in the account are continuously appropriated for purposes of the program.
This bill would require that the program be known as the California Dental Corps Loan Repayment Program and would revise program provisions regarding eligibility, application, selection, and placement. The bill would require the board to develop a process for repayment of loans or grants disbursed if the participant is terminated from the program or is not able to complete the required service obligation, as provided.

"Existing law prohibits the taking or possession of a fully protected fish, except as provided, and designates the unarmored threespine stickleback as a fully protected fish. The California Endangered Species Act prohibits the taking of an endangered or threatened species, except as specified. The Department of Fish and Wildlife may authorize the take of listed species if the take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and the impacts are minimized and fully mitigated.

Existing law authorizes an authority to borrow money, receive grants, or accept financial or other assistance or investment from the state or any other public agency for any project within its area of operation.
This bill would authorize an authority to also receive funds allocated to it pursuant to a resolution adopted by a city, county, or special district to transfer these funds from certain tax and assessment revenues, subject to specified requirements as to the use of those funds.","Amends the Government Code to create a community revitalization and investment authority, the powers and duties of which shall be to carry out a community revitalization plan within a community subdivision and investment area.

Existing law also contains administrative provisions that are generally applicable to voluntary contributions.
This bill would repeal these provisions regarding contributions for the support of the California Senior Legislature Fund and would instead allow a taxpayer, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, to designate an amount in excess of personal income tax liability to be deposited to the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund, which the bill would create. This bill would require moneys transferred to the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to be allocated to the Franchise Tax Board and the Controller, as provided, and to the California Senior Legislature for the purpose of funding the activities of the California Senior Legislature, as provided.
The bill would require the California Senior Legislature’s Internet Web site to report specified information, including all events the California Senior Citizen Advocacy Fund supports each year.
This bill would repeal these voluntary contribution provisions by a specified date or, if contributions made on returns would be less than a specified amount, by an earlier date as provided.","This bill amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to repeal the tax credit for contributions to the California Senior Legislature.

Existing law requires that prior to the delivery of health care via telehealth, the health care provider initiating the use of telehealth inform the patient about the use of telehealth and obtain documented verbal or written consent from the patient for the use of telehealth.
This bill would add video

(2) Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law prohibits health care service plans and health insurers from limiting the type of setting where services are provided for the patient or by the health care provider before payment is made for the covered services appropriately provided through telehealth, subject to the terms and conditions of the contract entered into between the enrollee, insured, subscriber, or policyholder and the plan or insurer, and between the plan or insurer and its participating providers or provider groups.
This bill would also prohibit a health care provider from requiring the use of telehealth when
a patient prefers to receive health care services in person

The bill would prohibit a health care service plan or health insurer from limiting coverage or reimbursement based on a contract entered into between the plan or insurer and an independent telehealth provider. The bill would prohibit a health care service plan or a health insurer from
interfering with the physician-patient

relationship based on the modality utilized for services appropriately provided through telehealth.
The bill would provide that all laws regarding the confidentiality of health care information and a patient’s right to his or her medical information shall apply to telehealth services.
Because a willful violation of the bill’s provisions by a health care service plan would be a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.

The bill also requires the State Water Resources Control Board to ensure that individual and cumulative effects of water diversion and discharge associated with cultivation of cannabis do not affect the instream flows needed for spawning, migration, and rearing of fish, and the flows needed to maintain natural flow variability. The bill grants USDA authority necessary for the implementation of specified regulations, including to: provide that weighing or measuring devices used in connection with the sale or distribution of medical cannabis are required to meet standards equivalent to Division 5 of the Environmental Quality Act; require that cannabis cultivation by licensees is conducted in accordance with state and local laws; establish procedures for the issuance and revocation of unique identifiers for activities associated with a license; and prescribe standards for the reporting of information necessary for the reporting of pest control information.

Until July 1, 2017, existing law authorizes a school district within the boundaries of which at least one parent or the legal guardian of a pupil is physically employed for a minimum of 10 hours during the school week to allow that pupil to attend a school in that school district through grade 12 if the parent or legal guardian of the pupil so chooses and if the parent or legal guardian of the pupil continues to be physically employed by an employer situated within the attendance boundaries of the school district.
This bill would indefinitely extend the operation of the provision authorizing the school district within the boundaries of which a parent or legal guardian of a pupil is physically employed for a minimum of 10 hours during the school week to allow that pupil to attend a school in that school district.","This bill amends the Education Code, as amended by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, to allow a school district to deem a pupil to have complied with the residency requirements for school attendance in that school district if he or she is any of the following: a pupil placed within the boundaries of that school district in a regularly established licensed children's institution, or a licensed foster home, or a family home pursuant to a commitment or placement under the Welfare and Institutions Code; a foster child who remains in his or her school of origin; a pupil for whom interdistrict attendance has been approved; a pupil whose residence is located within the boundaries of that school district and whose parent or legal guardian is relieved of responsibility, control, and authority through emancipation; a pupil who lives in the home of a caregiving adult that is located within the school district boundaries; a pupil residing in a state hospital located within the school district boundaries; and a pupil whose parent or legal guardian resides outside the boundaries of that school district but is employed and lives with the pupil at the place of his or her employment within the boundaries of the school district for a minimum of three days during the school week.

"Existing law imposes a minimum franchise tax of $800, except as provided, on every corporation incorporated in this state, qualified to transact intrastate business in this state, or doing business, as defined, in this state, and an annual tax in an amount equal to the minimum franchise tax on every limited liability company registered, qualified to transact business, or doing business in this state, as specified. Existing law requires every limited liability company subject to that annual tax to pay annually to this state a fee equal to specified amounts based upon total income from all sources attributable to this state. Existing law requires every partnership to file a return that includes specified information, verified by a written declaration made under the penalty of perjury and signed by one of the partners, within a specified time period.
This
bill
bill, for each taxable year beginning before January 1, 2020,
would exempt a limited liability company that is a qualified investment partnership, as defined, from that annual tax and fee by excluding it from the definition of a limited liability company. The bill would require that entity to submit a return under the conditions applicable to a partnership.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.",Access to Angel Investors Act - Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to revise the tax treatment of limited liability companies doing business in California. Exempts a limited liability company from such tax if it is: (1) a qualified investment partnership; or (2) a small business solely owned by a deployed member of the United States Armed Forces.
"(1) Existing law required, on or before July 1, 2014, the governing boards of school districts and county boards of education to adopt a local control and accountability plan using a state template adopted by the State Board of Education. Existing law requires the local control and accountability plan to include, among other things, a description of annual goals for all pupils and specified subgroups of pupils to be achieved for each state priority, as specified, and a description of the specific actions the school district or county superintendent of schools will take to achieve those goals. Existing law requires the charter petition for a charter school to include those same elements. Existing law provides that an adopted local control and accountability plan is effective for 3 years and shall be updated annually on or before July 1. Existing law requires the state board, on or before October 1, 2016, to adopt evaluation rubrics to, among other things, assist a school district, county office of education, or charter school in evaluating its strengths, weaknesses, and areas that require improvement. Existing law establishes the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence for purposes of advising and assisting school districts, county superintendents of schools, and charter schools in achieving the goals set forth in a local control and accountability plan.
This bill would, for purposes of a statewide accountability system and to ensure alignment and fidelity with the state priorities and federal law, require the state board to adopt a statewide accountability system that, among other things, is a single integrated system that aligns local, state, and federal accountability requirements. In identifying appropriate assistance for a school or local educational agency, the bill would require the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence and county superintendents of schools to analyze data aligned with all the state priorities in order to align the level of support, collaboration, and intervention to the needs of the local educational agency or individual school or schools. By imposing additional duties on county superintendents of schools, and to the extent this bill would impose additional duties on local educational agency officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 23, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require the California State Board of Education, for purposes of establishing a statewide accountability system, to adopt a system that: is a single, integrated system that aligns local, state, and federal accountability requirements; satisfies the requirements of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act; and Aligns Californias local control framework, which is focused on identifying and supporting local educational agencies (LEAs) with the need to identify, support, and improve Californias highest need schools. The system must: set clear, ambitious statewide standards for performance and expectations for improvement toward specified key indicators for pupil overall and for each significant subgroup; establish a mechanism to meaningfully differentiate the performance of all public schools and LEAs based on outcomes for all pupils and for each specified subgroup; and identify all schools in which any one subgroup would lead that school to the lowest 5% of all schools receiving federal Title I funds and all public high schools in the state numerically failing to graduate one-third or more of their pupils. The system must also: enable school districts, county offices of education, the Department"
"The Local Agency Public Construction Act establishes procedures and requirements for contracting by local agencies for the construction of public works, including the requirement to award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder. Existing law governing specified water districts requires those districts to use competitive bidding and to award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder.
This bill would allow a local agency to use the construction manager at-risk, design-build, or design-build-operate method of delivery on a surface storage project, as described. The bill would require these contracts to be awarded on a best value basis or to the lowest responsible bidder, and establish a procurement process for these contracts. The bill would require the bidder to certify specified information under penalty of perjury. By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also prohibit a contracting entity from being prequalified or short-listed unless it provides an enforceable commitment to the local agency that the entity and its subcontractors will use a skilled and trained workforce to perform all work on the project or contract that falls within an apprenticeable occupation in the building and construction trades, as specified.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill authorizes the Department of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation, to use the following methods of project delivery for a surface storage project in California that receives funding pursuant to the CALFED Bay-Delta Program Record of Decision, dated August 28, 2000: (1) construction manager at-risk; (2) design-build, including conventional, progressive, and target price; and (3) design-build-operate. The contract shall be awarded on a best value basis or to the lowest responsible bidder."
"Existing law requires each county to provide cash assistance and other social services to needy families through the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program using federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant program, state, and county funds. Existing law specifies the amounts of cash aid to be paid each month to CalWORKs recipients.
Existing law establishes the Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Foster Care (AFDC-FC) program, under which counties provide payments to foster care providers on behalf of qualified children in foster care. Under existing law, a child who is placed in the approved home of a relative is eligible for AFDC-FC if he or she is eligible for federal financial participation in the AFDC-FC payment, as specified. Existing law provides for benefits for a child who is placed in the approved home of a relative and who is ineligible for AFDC-FC pursuant to the CalWORKs program. Existing law establishes the Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program in counties choosing to participate, for the purpose of making the amount paid to relative caregivers for the in-home care of children placed with them who are ineligible for AFDC-FC payments equal to the amount paid on behalf of children who are eligible for AFDC-FC payments.
This bill would
require
require, until January 1, 2020, and subject to the availability of funds,
counties participating in the Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program to pay to an approved relative caregiver, for each child eligible for benefits pursuant to the program, an annual clothing allowance of $240 for a cumulative total of three years.
Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.
This bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code to establish the Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program for making the amount paid to approved relative caregivers for the in-home care of children placed with them who are ineligible for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC-FC) payments equal to the amount paid on behalf of children who are eligible for AFDC-FC payments. Directs participating counties, until January 1, 2020, to pay an approved relative caregiver an annual clothing allowance of two hundred dollars ($240) for each child eligible for welfare benefits pursuant to this Act. Requires any income or benefits received by an eligible child or the approved relative caregiver on behalf of such child that would be offset against the basic rate paid to a foster care provider to be offset against any funds that are not CalWORKs funds paid to the approved relative caregiver pursuant to this Act."
"Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of the practice of accountancy by the California Board of Accountancy within the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law authorizes the board to make a determination based on specified factors about whether allowing individuals from a particular state to practice pursuant to a practice privilege violates the board’s duty to protect the public and requires the board, if it were to make such a determination, to require those individuals, except as specified, to file the notification form and pay specified fees as a condition to exercising a practice privilege in this state.
This bill would authorize the board to adopt emergency regulations in order to implement the above-described provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 19, 2015. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Business and Professions Code to revise requirements for state accounting board notification forms to require out-of-state accountants licensed in a state to file a notification form and pay applicable fees if the state accounting board determines that allowing out-of-state accountants to practice in that state violates its duty to protect the public. The notification form must include the disciplinary history of licensees previously filed by a licensee through the practice privilege form. (Sec. 2) If the National Association of State Boards of California adopts enforcement best practices guidelines, the board issues a finding after a public hearing that those practices meet or exceed the board's own enforcement practices, a state has in place and is operating pursuant to enforcement practices substantially equivalent to the best practices guidelines, and the state's licensees are publicly available through the Internet in a manner that allows the board to link consumers to an Internet website to obtain information that was previously made available to consumers through the practice privilege form by out-of-state licensees of that state before January 1, 2013."
"Existing law requires a city or county that determines that a project, as defined, is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act to identify any public water system that may supply water for the project and to request those public water systems to prepare a specified water supply assessment. If no public water system is identified, the city or county is required to prepare the water supply assessment.
Existing law defines “project” for purposes of these provisions as, among other things, a project that would demand an amount of water equivalent to, or greater than, the amount of water required by a 500 dwelling unit project. For a public water system that has fewer than 5,000 service connections, existing law defines “project” as development that would account for a specified increase in the number of service connections. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, exempts from the definition of “project” a proposed photovoltaic or wind energy generation facility that would demand no more than 75 acre-feet of water annually.
This bill would, until January 1, 2018, exempt the above-described proposed photovoltaic or wind energy generation facilities from the definition of “project.” The bill would thereby extend the duties on local agencies with respect to determining whether a project is subject to the water supply assessment requirements, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on December 7, 2011.

"Existing law relating to property transfers prohibits the acknowledgment of an instrument unless the officer taking it has satisfactory evidence that the person making the acknowledgment is the individual who is described in and who executed the instrument. Existing law provides that an officer may reasonably rely on, among other things, a passport issued by a foreign government, a driver’s license issued by another state or a Canadian or Mexican public agency, an identification card issued by another state or a branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, or an employee identification card issued by an agency or office of this state or a city, county, or city and county in this state, provided that the document meets certain requirements. In the event the document is a passport, it must be stamped by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security.
This bill, instead of that provision pertaining to a passport issued by a foreign government, would authorize the acceptance of a valid passport from the applicant’s country of citizenship, or a valid consular identification document issued by a consulate from the applicant’s country of citizenship, as proof of identity. The bill would eliminate the requirement that the passport be stamped by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 1185 of the Civil Code proposed by SB 997 that would become operative if this bill and SB 997 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.","Amends Federal highway law to prohibit the taking of an acknowledgment of an instrument unless the officer taking it has satisfactory evidence that the person making the acknowledgment is the individual named in the document and that each of the following are true: (1) the person making the acknowledgment is the person named in the document; (2) the person making the acknowledgment is personally known to the witness; (3) that it is the reasonable belief of the witness that the circumstances of the person making the acknowledgment are such that it would be very difficult or impossible for that person to obtain another form of identification; (4) the witness does not possess any such identification documents; (5) the witness does not have a financial interest in the document being acknowledged and is not named in the document; or (6) a notary public who violates this section by failing to obtain the satisfactory evidence required by this Act.

"Existing law requires, if the owner of a total loss salvage vehicle retains possession of the vehicle, the insurance company to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles of the retention, as specified. Existing law requires the owner, within 10 days from the settlement of loss, to forward to the department the properly endorsed certificate of ownership or other evidence of ownership acceptable to the department, the license plates, and a specified fee. Upon receipt of these items, existing law requires the department to issue a salvage certificate for the vehicle. Prior to the sale or disposal of a total loss salvage vehicle, existing law requires the owner, the owner’s agent, or salvage pool to obtain a properly endorsed salvage certificate and deliver the certificate to the purchaser within 10 days after payment in full for the salvage vehicle, as specified. A violation of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to this provision.","Provides that whenever an insurance company makes a total loss settlement on a total loss salvage vehicle, the insurance company, an occupational licensee of the Department of Transportation, an authorized salvage pool, or a salvage pool authorized by the insurance company, within ten days from the settlement of the loss, shall forward the properly endorsed certificate of ownership or other evidence of ownership acceptable to the department, the license plates, and a fee in the amount of 15 dollars ($15). Authorizes an occupational licensee to submit a certificate of license plate in lieu of the actual license plate.

"Existing law grants a person a lien on a vehicle, dependent upon possession, for the compensation connected with repairing, furnishing supplies, storing, or renting parking space for that vehicle. Existing law establishes how the lien arises and how it may be extinguished.

"(1) The California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009 provides for the regulation of private postsecondary educational institutions by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education in the Department of Consumer Affairs. The act also establishes the Student Tuition Recovery Fund and requires the bureau to adopt regulations governing the administration and maintenance of the fund, including requirements relating to assessments on students and student claims against the fund, and establishes that the moneys in this fund are continuously appropriated to the bureau for specified purposes.
This bill would appropriate the sum of $1,300,000 from the Student Tuition Recovery Fund to the Attorney General for the purposes of providing grants to eligible nonprofit community service organizations to assist eligible students affected by the closure of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., as defined, with loan discharge and other student loan-related requests and tuition recovery-related claims, and to pay an amount not to exceed $150,000 for the reasonable administrative costs of the Attorney General’s office related to these grants, as specified. The bill would require the bureau to notify the Attorney General of all unlawful Corinthian Colleges closures within 15 days of the effective date of these provisions. The bill would require the Attorney General to, among other things, within 90 days of the notification, solicit grant applications from eligible nonprofit community service organizations, select one or more of these organizations deemed to be qualified, and set additional terms and conditions of the grants as necessary. The bill would provide that any unused funds are to be returned to the Attorney General for return to the Student Tuition Recovery Fund, except that, upon the approval of the Attorney General, an eligible nonprofit community service organization may expend those unused funds to provide assistance to students who were enrolled at an institution approved to operate by the bureau and who were harmed by the unlawful closure of that institution. The bill would set a schedule for how grant funds are to be distributed. The bill would require the grantee to submit specified information to the Attorney General on a quarterly basis, and require the Attorney General to make these reports available to the Legislature and the bureau upon request. The bill would require the Attorney General to provide the Legislature and the bureau a final report summarizing all the information submitted to it by grantees, promptly following the time when all funds are expended by the grantees, or by January 1, 2019, whichever is earlier. The bill would authorize the Attorney General to contract with another qualified entity to perform the Attorney General’s duties under these provisions.
(2) This bill would, until July 1, 2020, authorize state agencies that provide licensure to consider for licensure students who were enrolled in an educational program of Corinthian Colleges, Inc., designed to lead to licensure from that state agency, and who did not receive that licensure due to the institution’s closure.
(3) The Cal Grant Program prohibits an applicant from receiving Cal Grant awards totaling in excess of the amount equivalent to the award level for a total of 4 years of full-time attendance in an undergraduate program, except as provided.
This bill would partially exempt from this limitation on Cal Grant awards a student who was enrolled and received a Cal Grant award at a California campus of Heald College, and who was unable to complete an educational program offered by the campus due to its closure.
(4) The California National Guard Education Assistance Award Program authorizes the renewal of California National Guard Education Assistance Awards, for a maximum of the greater of either 4 years of full-time equivalent enrollment or the duration for which the qualifying member would otherwise be eligible pursuant to the Cal Grant Program, if specified conditions are met.
This bill would partially exempt from this limitation on California National Guard Education Assistance Awards a student who was enrolled and received a California National Guard Education Assistance Award at a California campus of Heald College, and who was unable to complete an educational program offered by the campus due to its closure.
(5) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.","(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prohibit the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education from providing funds to He College, Inc., or any of its affiliate institutions, pursuant to the Federal Family Education Loan, Direct Loan, or Perkins Loan programs, unless a student eligible for such assistance was enrolled at one of the colleges' campuses that closed on April 27, 2015, and withdrew from enrollment after June 20, 2014. The bill makes students who were enrolled at one of the colleges' campuses that closed on April 27, 2015, eligible for: (1) a closed school loan discharge if they do not transfer earned credit and subsequently completes a comparable program at another institution; (2) debt relief under a borrower defense to repayment if they were victims of fraud or other violations of state law by such colleges; or (3) a student who intends to submit a borrower defense claim while his or her claim is reviewed.

The credit would be allowed in an amount equal to the difference between the special minimum wage and the state minimum wage, multiplied by the hours worked by the qualified employee.
The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to submit a report containing specified data relating to these credits to the Legislature by June 1, 2022.

"Existing law generally regulates the provision of bail or bond, including forfeiture, vacation of forfeiture, and exoneration of bail or bond. Existing law requires the court to declare bail to be forfeited if, without sufficient excuse, a defendant fails to appear as specified. Existing law denies the court jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture and requires the bail to be released of all obligations under the bond if the case is dismissed or if no complaint is filed within 15 days from the date of arraignment.
This bill would authorize an extension of the court’s jurisdiction to declare a forfeiture and authority to release bail for not more than 90 days from the date of the arraignment if the arraignment is properly continued to allow the prosecutor time to file the complaint or if the defendant requests the extension in writing or in open court.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the State of California criminal code to modify the procedure for a court to release a surety or depositor from bond after a defendant fails to appear in court for either a trial or to surrender his or her property if the case is dismissed or if no complaint is filed within 15 days from the date of the arraignment. Authorizes the court to extend the time to file a complaint if the prosecutor requests that the case be continued to file in open court. Requires the court, if the requests of the prosecutor exceed the amount of the forfeited bond or the bond amount, to release the defendant or persons in custody after the appeal of the decision of the court. Provides: (1) for the release of a surety or depositor after a defendant fails to appear in court for either a trial or to surrender his or her property if the case is dismissed or if no complaint is filed within 15 days from the date of the arraignment; and (2) that the court shall not have jurisdiction to declare the situations described above if the case is dismissed or if no complaint is filed within such time."
"Existing law authorizes certain persons, including, among others, any person 16 years of age or older, to have his or her proficiency in basic skills taught in public high schools verified according to criteria established by the State Department of Education. Existing law requires the State Board of Education to award a certificate of proficiency to persons who demonstrate that proficiency. Existing law requires the department to develop standards of competency in basic skills taught in public high schools and to provide for the administration of examinations prepared by, or with the approval of, the department to verify competency. Existing law authorizes the department to charge a fee for each examination application in an amount sufficient to recover the costs of administering the requirements of these provisions but prohibits the fee from exceeding an amount equal to the cost of test renewal and administration per examination application. Existing law prohibits the department from charging the fee to an examinee who qualifies as a homeless child or youth and meets other specified criteria.
This bill would additionally prohibit the department from charging the fee to a foster youth, as defined, who is under 25 years of age.
Existing law separately requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to issue a high school equivalency certificate and an official score report, or an official score report only, to a person who has not completed high school and who meets specified requirements, including, among others, having taken all or a portion of a general education development test that has been approved by the state board and administered by a testing center approved by the department, with a score determined by the state board to be equal to the standard of performance expected from high school graduates. Existing law authorizes the Superintendent to charge an examinee a one-time fee to pay costs related to administering these provisions and issuing a certificate, as specified. Existing law limits the amount of the fee to $20 per person and requires each scoring contractor to forward that fee to the Superintendent. Existing law prohibits a scoring contractor or testing center that charges its own separate fee from charging that separate fee to an examinee who qualifies as a homeless child or youth, is under 25 years of age, and can verify his or her status as a homeless child or youth.
This bill would additionally prohibit the scoring contractor or testing center from charging the fee to a foster youth, as defined, who is under 25 years of age.
Existing law requires the Superintendent, on or before December 1, 2018, to submit 2 reports to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, one relating to high school proficiency tests, and one relating to high school equivalency tests, that each include, among other things, the number of homeless youth that took a high school proficiency or equivalency test in each of the 2016, 2017, and 2018 calendar years, and the impact of the opportunity to take a high school proficiency or equivalency test at no cost on the number and percentage of homeless youth taking a high school proficiency or equivalency test.
This bill would require the Superintendent to also incorporate data on high school proficiency or equivalency test examinees who are foster youth, as defined, into each report.","This bill amends the Education Code to require that a person 16 years of age or older or who has been enrolled in the 10th grade for one academic year or longer, or who will complete one academic year of enrollment in the 10th grade at the end of the semester during which the next regular examination will be conducted, may have his or her proficiency in basic skills taught in public high schools verified according to criteria established by the California Department of Education. The state board shall award a certificate of proficiency to persons who demonstrate that proficiency. The certificate of proficiency shall be equivalent to a high school diploma and the department shall keep a permanent record of the issuance of all certificates. The bill requires the department to: (1) develop standards of competency in basic skills taught in public high schools, and (2) provide for the administration of examinations prepared by or with the approval of the department to verify competency. Regular examinations shall be held once in the fall semester and once in the spring semester of every academic year on a date that will enable notification of examinees and the schools they attend, if any, of the results thereof not later than two weeks before the date on which that semester ends in a majority of school districts that maintain high schools.

Existing law provides various exemptions from the taxes imposed by those laws.
This bill, on and after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2030, would exempt from those taxes the gross receipts from the sale of, and the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of, hydrogen refueling station equipment, as defined, purchased by a recipient of a grant pursuant to the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program for the development of hydrogen refueling stations.
The Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing law authorizes districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which generally conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to state sales and use taxes are incorporated into these laws.
Section 2230 of the Revenue and Taxation Code provides that the state will reimburse counties and cities for revenue losses caused by the enactment of sales and use tax exemptions.
This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2230 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse any local agencies for sales and use tax revenues lost by them pursuant to this bill.

The bill would require the commission to update the criteria by July 1, 2017, to identify the value of maintaining existing baseload resources to achieve the goal of a balanced portfolio of eligible renewable energy resources.","(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on November 16, 2010. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Public Utilities Code to require the California Energy Commission to direct: (1) each electrical corporation to prepare annually a renewable energy procurement plan that satisfies its obligations under the California Renewables Portfolio Standard; (2) every electrical corporation that owns electrical transmission facilities to report annually to the Commission any electrical transmission facility upgrade, or enhancement that is reasonably necessary to achieve the renewable energy resources procurement requirements of this Act; (3) each retail seller to prepare and submit an annual compliance report that includes the current status and progress made toward procurement of eligible renewable energy resources as a percentage of retail sales, and toward construction and upgrades to transmission and distribution facilities and other electrical system components it owns to interconnect eligible renewable energy resources and supply the electricity generated by those resources to load; and (4) the Commission to adopt a process that provides criteria for the rank ordering and selection of least-cost and best-fit eligible renewable energy resources to comply with the California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program obligations on a total cost and best-fit basis."
"(1) Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary schools in this state, and authorizes local educational agencies throughout the state to operate schools and provide instruction to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive.
This bill would appropriate, without regard to fiscal years, $2,000,000 from the General Fund to the Superintendent of Public Instruction to be allocated to specified local educational agencies for the purpose of implementing a pilot program to train teachers teaching kindergarten or any of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, to more effectively utilize technology and digital resources within their instructional day, while also measuring and teaching the critical 21st century skills pupils need to succeed on California’s next-generation online assessments, as well as to prepare pupils for college and career objectives, thereby making an appropriation.
The bill would require the Superintendent to develop an application process for the allocation of funds appropriated for the implementation of the pilot program that gives priority to applicant local educational agencies that serve a large percentage of pupils eligible for free or reduced-price meals. The bill would authorize any local educational agency in the state to apply to the Superintendent for funding to implement the pilot program, as specified. The bill would specify topics to be included in the training provided to teachers and pupils participating in the pilot program.
(2) Funds appropriated by this bill would be applied toward the minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts imposed by Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.
Existing law requires the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to issue a 5-year preliminary multiple subject teaching credential authorizing instruction in a self-contained classroom, a 5-year preliminary single subject teaching credential authorizing instruction in departmentalized classes, or a 5-year preliminary education specialist credential authorizing instruction of special education pupils to an out-of-state prepared teacher who meets specified requirements, including that the teacher possess a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those provisions and other related provisions.","This bill amends the Education Code to direct the Department of Education to award grants to local educational agencies that serve a large percentage of pupils eligible for free or reduced-price meals to implement a pilot program to train kindergarten, or any of grades one to 12, teachers more effectively use technology and digital resources within their instructional day, while also measuring and teaching the critical 21st century skills pupils need to succeed on California's next-generation online assessments and to prepare them for college and career objectives."
"Existing law, the Unruh Civil Rights Act, states that all persons within this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship, primary language, or immigration status are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments. Under existing law, the Department of Fair Employment and Housing is responsible for receiving, investigating, conciliating, mediating, and prosecuting complaints alleging a violation of the act.
This bill would enact the Stop Consumer Racial Profiling Act of 2016, which would prohibit a business establishment from using consumer racial profiling, as defined. The bill would also make the Department of Fair Employment and Housing responsible for the enforcement of the act.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 12930 of the Government Code, proposed by SB 1442, to be operative only if SB 1442 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 5, 2016. Stop Consumer Racial Profiling Act of 2016 (Sec. 2) This bill prohibits business establishments in California from using consumer racial profiling, which is the profiling or targeting of a person that results in differential treatment based on his or her race or ethnicity and that constitutes a denial or degradation in the product or service offered to customers. For purposes of this bill, &quot;consumer racial profiling&quot; includes, but is not limited to, refusal to serve, removal from the business establishment premises, segregated seating, requiring additional forms of identification, and surveillance practices based on race or ethnicity. The bill revises the duties of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to include providing for the investigation, prosecution, and dispute resolution functions and duties of the HUD."
"(1) Existing law creates the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA) and requires all insurers admitted to transact specified insurance lines in this state to become members. Each time an insurer becomes insolvent, to the extent necessary to secure funds for payment of covered claims of that insolvent insurer and also for payment of reasonable costs of adjusting the claims, CIGA is required to collect premium payments from its member insurers sufficient to discharge its obligations, as specified.
This bill, among other things, would no longer require an insurer to become insolvent in order for CIGA to collect premium payments from the member insurers and would require CIGA to collect premiums in order to secure funds for the payment of its administrative expenses.
(2) Under existing law, CIGA is required to be a party in interest in all proceedings involving a covered claim, and has the same rights as the insolvent insurer would have had if not in liquidation, but CIGA has no cause of action against the insureds of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out, except as provided.
This bill would provide that the above-stated provision denying CIGA a cause of action against insureds does not limit CIGA’s right to pursue unpaid reimbursements owed by an employer pursuant to a workers’ compensation insurance policy with a deductible if the employer was obligated to reimburse the insurer for benefits payments and related expenses paid by the insurer or CIGA from a special deposit or from other CIGA funds pursuant to the terms of the policy and related agreements.
(3) Existing law requires that the rate of premium charged be a uniform percentage of net direct written premium, as defined, in the preceding calendar year applicable to specific categories of insurance. The rate of premium charges to each member insurer in the appropriate categories are initially based on the written premium of each insurer as shown in the latest year’s annual financial statement on file with the Insurance Commissioner and are later adjusted, as provided. Existing law authorizes CIGA to refund any credit due in a specific category of insurance to a member insurer as a result of the adjusted premium calculation, as provided.
This bill would instead require CIGA, with regard to premium charges paid prior to January 1, 2017, to refund to a member insurer any credit due in a specific category as a result of the adjusted premium calculation.
This bill, with regard to premium charges paid on or after January 1, 2017, would delete the requirements that the rate of premium charges be initially based on the written premium of each insurer, that the premium charges be adjusted later as provided, and that the member insurer be eligible for a refund of any credit due to that member insurer as a result of the adjusted premium calculation, and would instead require that the rate of premium charges to each member insurer in the appropriate categories be based on the net direct written premium of each insurer as shown in the latest year’s annual financial statement on file with the commissioner. The bill would also make conforming changes.
(4) Existing law authorizes CIGA to exempt or defer a member insurer from paying the premium charge if the payment would cause the member insurer’s financial statement to reflect an amount of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance. Deferred premium charges are required to be paid when the payment will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. These payments are credited against future premium charges to those companies receiving larger premium charges by virtue of the deferment.
This bill would delete the requirement that the payments be credited against future premium charges to those companies receiving larger premium charges by virtue of the deferment.
(5) Existing law requires CIGA’s plan of operations to contain provisions requiring each member insurer to recoup the premium charge paid to CIGA from its insureds over a reasonable length of time by way of a reasonably calculated surcharge on insurance policies to which the provisions of CIGA apply.
This bill would instead require each member insurer to recoup the premium charge from its insureds in the year following the charge. The bill, with regard to premium charges paid on or after January 1, 2017, among other things, would require the member insurer to file a report in accordance with the provisions of the plan of operation indicating the amount of surcharges it has collected, and would prohibit a member insurer electing to omit collecting surcharges from any of its insureds from being entitled to any reimbursement from CIGA, as specified.","(Sec. 1) Amends the Insurance Code to require an insurance guaranty association in California to pay and discharge covered claims, and in connection therewith, pay for or loss adjustment services and defenses of claimants when required by policy provisions. Declares that the association shall be a party in interest in all proceedings involving a covered claim and shall have the same rights as the insolvent insurer would have had if not in liquidation, including the right to: (1) defend, defend, and appeal a claim in a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) receive notice of, investigate, adjust, compromise, settle, and pay a covered claim; and (3) investigate, handle, and deny a non-covered claim. Declares that the association shall have no cause of action against the insureds of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out, except as provided by this Act. Declares that nothing in this Act limits the association's right to pursue unpaid reimbursements owed by an employer pursuant to a workers compensation insurance policy with an insolvent insurer if the employer was obligated to reimburse the insurer for benefits payments and related expenses paid by the insurer from a special deposit or from other association funds pursuant to the terms of the policy and related agreements. Declares that if damages against uninsured motorists"

provisions. Existing law requires reimbursement to Medi-Cal pharmacy providers for drugs, as prescribed. As a condition for the participation of a pharmacy in the Medi-Cal program, and subject to specified exceptions, existing law requires the pharmacy, upon presentation of a valid prescription for a patient and the patient’s Medicare card, to charge Medicare beneficiaries a price that does not exceed the Medi-Cal reimbursement rate for prescription medicines and an amount, as set by the department, to cover electronic transmission charges.
Existing law prohibits Medicare beneficiaries from being allowed to use the Medi-Cal reimbursement rate for over-the-counter medications or compound medications. Existing law provides that these provisions do not apply to a prescription that is covered by insurance. Existing law requires the department to conduct an outreach program to inform Medicare beneficiaries of their right to participate in this program.
This bill would
require the State Department of Health Care Services, on or before February 1, 2017, to report to the Legislature on the effectiveness of the Medi-Cal pharmacy procedures described above, as specified, and other options and strategies to achieve the greatest savings on prescription drugs for patients.
expand these provisions to also apply to any patient upon presentation of a valid prescription for the patient and evidence of residency in California. The bill would provide that for purposes of these provisions “covered by insurance” does not apply to a prescription for a specific medication prescribed for a patient that is not included on the drug formulary maintained by that patient’s health care service plan or health insurer, and for which the patient is prepared to pay cash.","This bill amends the Business and Professions Code, with respect to the Medi-Cal program, to require a pharmacy participating in the program, upon presentation of a valid prescription for the patient and the patient's Medicare card, card, or evidence of residency in California, to charge Medicare beneficiaries or other patients a price that does not exceed the Medi-Cal reimbursement rate for prescription medicines, and an amount as set by the state Department of Health Care Services to cover electronic transmission charges. However, Medicare beneficiaries or other patients shall not be allowed to use the rate for over-the-counter medications or compounded prescriptions. The state Department of Health Care Services shall: (1) provide a mechanism to calculate and transmit the price to the pharmacy, but shall not apply the Medi-Cal drug utilization review process for purposes of this bill; and (2) conduct an outreach program to inform Medicare beneficiaries and California residents of their right to participate in the program. The state Department of Health Care Services shall: (1) report that fact to the appropriate committees of the Legislature, and (2) conduct an outreach program to inform Medicare beneficiaries of their right to participate."
"The California Meat and Poultry Supplemental Inspection Act requires, until January 1, 2017, each person to be licensed before operating a meat processing establishment or a custom livestock slaughterhouse and sets annual license renewal fees for custom livestock slaughterhouses and meat processing establishments. The act, until January 1, 2017, also establishes application fees for initial and renewal of licenses for livestock meat inspectors and processing inspectors. The act imposes a penalty on applicants for renewal who fail to pay the renewal fee by the expiration date of the meat processing establishment, custom livestock slaughterhouse, livestock meat inspector, or processing inspector license and provides cause for revocation of the license if the applicant fails to pay the renewal fee, plus the penalty, within 90 days of the license’s expiration.
Existing law provides for the regulation, inspection, and licensing of poultry plants and for the regulation and licensing of poultry meat inspectors. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, specifies the license application fees for a new, previously unlicensed poultry plant and for a license application submitted upon change of ownership of an existing, previously licensed poultry plant. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, requires that an application for renewal of a license of a poultry plant, accompanied by a specified renewal fee, be made on or before the expiration of the license.
Existing law, until January 1, 2017, specifies the application fee for a poultry meat inspector license application and the renewal fee of that license. Existing law, until January 1, 2017, imposes a penalty of $25 on applicants for renewal who fail to pay the renewal fee by the expiration date of the license, and provides for revocation of the license if the applicant fails to pay the renewal fee, plus the penalty, within 90 days of the license’s expiration.
This bill would extend these licensing and inspector provisions to January 1, 2022, and would delete an obsolete provision.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 13, 2016. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Food and Agricultural Code to modify the application fee for a meat processing establishment or a custom livestock slaughterhouse in California. The fee is currently $100, and it requires the payment of an additional application fee if an applicant does not take examination within one year after receipt of the application by the Department of Agriculture. The fee shall expire on the last day of the calendar year for which it is issued. The bill also revises the application fee for a meat processing establishment or a custom livestock slaughterhouse. The fee is currently five dollars per head of livestock, and it requires the number of head of livestock slaughtered by the custom livestock slaughterhouse during the preceding October through September time period to be based on the number of head of livestock slaughtered by the slaughterhouse during the preceding October through September time period. The fee for an annual renewal of a license for a meat processing establishment or a custom livestock slaughterhouse is five dollars per head of livestock, and it requires the number of head of livestock slaughtered by the slaughterhouse during the preceding October through September time period to be based on the number of head of livestock slaughtered by the slaughterhouse during such period.

"Existing law establishes the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge certain children to be dependents of the court under certain circumstances, including when the child is abused, a parent or guardian fails to adequately supervise or protect the child, as specified, or a parent or guardian fails to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment. Existing law declares that a child is within the dependency jurisdiction of the juvenile court if the child is a victim of sexual trafficking, or receives food, shelter, or money in exchange for specified sexual acts, as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to protect the child, and declares that this is declaratory of existing law.
This bill would additionally include a child within the dependency jurisdiction of the juvenile court if the child solicits or engages in any act of prostitution or loiters in a public place with the intent to commit prostitution, and the child’s parent or guardian has failed to protect the child. The bill would state that these provisions are declaratory of existing law.
The Arnold-Kennick Juvenile Court Law provides that any person who is under 18 years of age when he or she violates any criminal law while in this state, except an age curfew ordinance or any other specified offense, comes within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge the person a ward of the court.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to that provision.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code, with respect to requirements for the protection of dependent children, to provide that a child shall not be found to be a person described by such Act solely due to the lack of an emergency shelter for the family shelter if the child comes within the jurisdiction of the court on the basis that there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer serious physical harm inflicted by: (1) the parent or guardian; or (2) the child held parent or guardian to adequately protect the child from conduct with whom the child has been abused, or willful or negligent failure of the parent or guardian to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment, or by the inability of the parent or guardian to provide regular care for the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment, or by the inability to provide regular care for the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment, or by the inability of the parent or guardian to provide regular care for the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment, or by the inability to provide regular care for the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment, or by the inability of the parent or guardian to provide regular care for the child with"

Under existing law, local health agencies are primarily responsible for enforcing the code. A person who violates any provision of the code is guilty of a misdemeanor, except as otherwise provided.
This bill would, among other things, require the department to identify a list of ready-to-eat foods that have a high level of risk associated with consumption after a specified date and to post that list on its Internet Web site. The bill would, beginning July 1, 2017, require a food manufacturer or retail food facility that chooses to include a quality date, as defined, on foods for sale that are not identified on the department’s list to display that date using the phrase “best if used by” in 8-point type size or larger type, as specified.

Existing law makes a violation of this provision a public offense punishable upon a first conviction by imprisonment, as specified, or a fine not exceeding $50,000, or by imprisonment and that fine.
This bill would provide that the payment or receipt of consideration for advertising, wherein a licensed healing arts practitioner offers or sells services through a third-party advertiser, does not constitute a referral of patients when the third-party advertiser does not itself recommend, endorse, or otherwise select a licensee.

"(1) Existing law provides that an obligation is extinguished by a release given to the debtor by the creditor, upon a new consideration, or in writing, with or without new consideration. A general release does not extend to claims the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.
Under this bill, a partial or interim payment or reimbursement, made in connection with an environmental disaster by the responsible polluter or any agent or entity related to the responsible polluter to any recipient, would not release the polluter from liability to the recipient for any claim related to the environmental disaster or for any future claim by the recipient against the polluter, or for both current and future claims. The bill would prohibit any such partial or interim payment or reimbursement from being conditioned upon the recipient’s agreement to release the polluter from liability for any current or future claim. The bill would allow such a payment or reimbursement to any recipient to be credited against the liability of the polluter, agent, or entity to the recipient for any current or future claim that is related to the environmental disaster.
Under the bill, a temporary or final settlement of any kind made in connection with an environmental disaster by the responsible polluter or any agent or entity related to the responsible polluter, to any claimant, would release the responsible polluter, agent, or entity from liability to the claimant only for acts, omissions, or injuries that are believed by the claimant to have occurred prior to the date of the settlement, and would not release any claim that is unknown to the claimant at the time of the settlement, occurs subsequent to the settlement, or that is unrelated to the environmental disaster.
The bill would make any agreement in violation of those prohibitions that is entered into on or after February 1, 2017, void as a matter of law and against public policy.
(2) Existing law establishes statutes of limitations for civil actions for injury or illness or wrongful death based upon exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance other than asbestos, as specified. For injury or illness, the statute of limitations is 2 years from the date of injury, or 2 years after the plaintiff becomes aware of, or reasonably should have become aware of, an injury, the physical cause of the injury, and sufficient facts to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice that the injury was caused or contributed to by the wrongful act of another, whichever occurs later. For wrongful death, the statute of limitations is no later than either 2 years from the date of the death of the plaintiff’s decedent, or 2 years from the first date on which the plaintiff is aware of, or reasonably should have become aware of, the physical cause of the death and sufficient facts to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice that the death was caused or contributed to by the wrongful act of another, whichever occurs later.
This bill would, notwithstanding the above provision, establish a statute of limitations of 3 years for specified civil actions for injury, illness, or wrongful death based upon exposure to a hazardous material or toxic substance other than asbestos.
(3) Under existing law, except as attorneys’ fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys is left to the agreement of the parties.
This bill would authorize the court, in any action for private nuisance against an environmental polluter defendant arising out of an environmental disaster for which the defendant has been adjudged civilly liable, upon motion, to award reasonable attorneys’ fees to a prevailing plaintiff against the defendant.
(4) This bill would limit the application of its provisions to damages caused by an environmental disaster that occurred at Southern California Gas Company’s Aliso Canyon gas storage facility, as specified, or contamination surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in the City of Vernon. The bill would specify that its provisions do not apply to any action against a public entity, as defined.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for these regions.","This bill amends the Civil Code to prohibit a responsible polluter or related entity from releasing the polluter from liability to any recipient for any claim related to an environmental disaster that occurred at Southern California Gas Companys Aliso Canyon gas storage facility or contamination surrounding the Exide Technologies facility in Vernon, California, unless the recipient agrees to release the polluter from liability for any current or future claim. A responsible polluter or related entity may be credited against the liability of the recipient for any current or future claim related to the disaster. A temporary or final settlement of any kind made in connection with the disaster by the responsible polluter or any related entity shall release the responsible polluter, agent, or entity from liability to the claimant only for acts, omissions, or injuries that are believed by the claimant to have occurred prior to the date of the settlement and shall not release any claim that is unknown to the claimant at the time of the settlement, occurs subsequent to the settlement, or that is unrelated to the disaster. Any agreement in violation of such provision that is entered into on or after February 1, 2017, is void as a matter of law and against public policy. The provisions of this bill shall only apply to agreements relating to acts, omissions, or injuries in connection with an environmental disaster"
"Existing federal law governs the processing, storage, and use of human tissue and human cell, tissue, or cellular- or tissue-based products (HCT/P), as specified, and imposes certain regulatory duties relating to HCT/P upon the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Existing state law requires the State Department of Public Health to license and regulate tissue banks, which process, store, or distribute human tissue for transplantation into human beings. Existing law generally requires every tissue bank operating in this state to have a current and valid tissue bank license issued or renewed by the department, but exempts certain activities from that requirement, including the storage of HCT/P by a licensed physician or podiatrist, as specified, if the products were obtained from a California-licensed tissue bank, stored in strict accordance with manufacturer instructions, and used solely for the express purpose of direct implantation into or application on the practitioner’s own patient, among other criteria.
This bill would create an additional exemption from the tissue bank licensing requirement for the storage of allograft tissue by a person if that person is a hospital or outpatient setting, the person maintains a log including specified information pertaining to the allograft tissue, and the allograft tissue meets specified requirements, including, among other things, that the allograft tissue was obtained from a California-licensed tissue bank, is individually boxed and labeled with a unique identification number and expiration date, and is intended for the express purpose of implantation into or application on a patient.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)Amends the Health and Safety Code to exempt from licensing requirements for tissue banks: (1) the collection, processing, storage, or distribution of human whole blood or its derivatives; (2) the collection, processing, storage, or distribution of tissue for autopsy, biopsy, training, education, or for other medical or scientific research or investigation, when transplantation of the tissue is not intended or reasonably foreseeable; (3) the collection of tissue by an individual physician and surgeon from his or her patient or the implantation of tissue by an individual physician and surgeon into his or her patient; (4) the collection, processing, storage, or distribution of fetal tissue or tissue derived from a human embryo or fetus; (5) the collection, processing, storage, or distribution by an organ procurement organization if the OPO, at the time of collection, processing, storage, and distribution of the tissue, has been designated as an OPO and meets specified regulations; (6) the storage of prepackaged, freeze-dried bone by a general acute care hospital; (7) the storage of freeze-dried bone and by any licensed dentist acting within the scope and authority of his or her license and practicing in a"
"Existing law establishes the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund, a continuously appropriated fund, within the State Treasury administered by the Secretary of State, the sole purpose of which is to provide restitution to victims of corporate fraud. Existing law provides that an aggrieved person who obtains a final judgment, as specified, against a corporation based upon the corporation’s fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit, made with intent to defraud, may file an application with the Secretary of State for payment from the fund for the amount unpaid on the judgment that represents the awarded actual and direct loss to the claimant in the final judgment.
This bill would additionally apply those provisions if an aggrieved person obtains a criminal restitution order against an agent, as defined, of a corporation based upon those same circumstances. The bill would also make conforming changes. By allowing for additional payments to be made from the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund, this bill would make an appropriation.
Existing law requires the application filed with the Secretary of State to include specified information and documentation, and imposes criminal penalties for the filing of any documents that are false or untrue or contain any willful, material misstatements of fact.
This bill would require, if the final judgment is a criminal restitution order, the claimant to provide the charging document and the restitution order, and if the defendant is an agent, documentation showing the defendant named in the restitution order is an agent as defined in this bill. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law requires, if, at any time, the money deposited in the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund is insufficient to satisfy any duly authorized award or offer of settlement, the Secretary of State to, when sufficient money has been deposited in the fund, satisfy the unpaid award or offer of settlement, plus specified accumulated interest.
This bill would eliminate the requirement to pay that specified accumulated interest.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Corporations Code to allow an aggrieved person to file an application with the Secretary of State for payment from the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund: (1) upon obtaining a final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction against a corporation based upon the agent's fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit, made with intent to defraud while acting in the agent's capacity as the corporation's officer or director; and (2) upon the judgment becoming final and after diligent collection efforts are made, for the amount unpaid on the judgment that represents the awarded actual and direct loss, any awarded compensatory damages, and awarded costs to the claimant in the final judgment, excluding punitive damages."
"Existing law regulates the relationship between landlord and tenant and the terms and conditions of tenancies.
This bill would authorize a tenant to maintain a support animal, as defined, on the property if specified conditions are met. This bill would authorize a tenancy to be terminated or a tenant to be denied accommodations on the property for having a support animal if specified conditions apply. This bill would authorize the landlord to require tenants with support animals to adhere to all standards that are imposed uniformly on all tenants and to include the payment of an extra charge or security deposit for maintaining a support animal on the property. This bill would prohibit a tenant from maintaining any protected species, venomous reptiles, amphibians or insects, or any other illegal species as a support animal.
Existing law requires the owners of assistance dogs to comply with all state and local ordinances regarding health and licensure requirements.
This bill would expand that requirement by also making it applicable to support animals.
This bill would authorize a residential lease to require a tenant who possesses a support animal, as defined, on the rented premises or associated common areas to be subject to specified conditions, and would require a breach of these conditions, if contained in the lease, to be a breach of the lease. The bill would provide that a tenant or prospective tenant shall not be prohibited from possessing a support animal on the rented premises or associated common areas if the tenant or prospective tenant satisfies specified conditions.",Amends the Civil Code to allow a tenant to enter into a residential lease that requires the tenant to: (1) notify or receive approval from the landlord prior to bringing a support animal into the property; (2) be houseable; (3) not disturb the enjoyment of other tenants or pose a threat to other tenants or their property; and (4) not be prohibited from possessing such an animal. Permits a lease breach if the specified conditions are not met.
"Existing law provides for the creation of statewide and local transportation agencies, which may be established as joint powers authorities or established expressly by statute. Existing law establishes the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, which is authorized to acquire, construct, own, operate, control, or use rights-of-way, rail lines, bus lines, stations, platforms, switches, yards, terminals, parking lots, and any and all other facilities necessary or convenient for rapid transit service.
This bill would establish the Altamont Pass Regional Rail Authority for purposes of planning and delivering a cost effective and responsive interregional rail connection between the Bay Area Rapid Transit District’s rapid transit system and the Altamont Corridor Express in the Tri-Valley, within the City of Livermore, that meets the goals and objectives of the community. The bill would require the authority’s governing board to be composed of 12 representatives and would authorize the authority to appoint an executive who may appoint staff or retain consultants. The bill would provide specified authorizations and duties to the authority.
This bill would require all unencumbered moneys dedicated for the completion of the connection to be transferred to the authority. The bill would require the Bay Area Rapid Transit District to assume ownership of all physical improvements, and to assume operational control, maintenance responsibilities, and related financial obligations for the connection, upon its completion. The bill would require the Department of Transportation to expedite reviews and requests related to the connection. The bill would require the authority to provide a project update report to the public, to be posted on the authority’s Internet Web site, on the development and implementation of the connection.
By imposing new duties on local governmental entities, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
Existing law, until January 1, 2021, prohibits a toll from being imposed on the passage of a pedestrian or bicycle over any bridge that is part of the state highway system, as specified.
This bill would extend that prohibition until January 1, 2022.","Establishes: (1) the Bay Area Rapid Transit District in California, to be known as the Bay Area Rapid Transit District San Joaquin Area Rapid Transit Express Project, or the Tri-Valley Corridor Project; and (2) the Bay Area Rapid Transit District board of directors, to be composed of the mayor of Alameda, the county of Alameda, the East Bay Leadership Council, and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. Authorizes the board of the Authority to appoint an executive director. Requires the initial phase of the Project to include a rail connection between the Bay Area Rapid Transit District and San Joaquin Area Rapid Transit Express in the first phase to address regional economic and transportation challenges. Requires the authority to award contracts for the initial phase to the city of Alameda, the county of Alameda, and the Authority. Requires the city to pay all contracts awarded by the authority to carry out the Project consistent with specified requirements."
"Existing law, the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, enacted by Proposition 47, as approved by the voters at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election, reduced the penalties for various crimes. Under the provisions of the act, a person currently convicted of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act if the act had been in effect at the time of the conviction may petition or apply to have the sentence reduced in accordance with the act. That act requires that this petition or application be filed before November 4, 2017, or at a later date upon a showing of good cause.
Proposition 47 authorizes its provisions to be amended by a statute that is consistent with and furthers its intent and that is passed by a
2/3
vote of each house of the Legislature and is signed by the Governor. Proposition 47 also provides that the Legislature may, by majority vote, amend, add, or repeal provisions to further reduce the penalties for offenses it addresses.
This bill would instead authorize a person to petition or apply for a reduction of sentence before November 4, 2022, or at a later date upon a showing of good cause. Because the bill would extend the period of time in which a person could file a petition or application without a showing of good cause, the bill would amend the act and would require a
2/3
vote of the Legislature.","This bill amends the California criminal code to allow a person who on November 5, 2014, was serving a sentence for a felony or a misdemeanor to petition for a recall sentence before the trial court that entered a judgment of conviction in his or her case to request resentencing, unless the court determines that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. The court may consider: the petitioner's originally criminal conviction history, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; the petitioner's disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and any other evidence the court determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. A person who is resentenced shall be given credit for time served and shall be subject to parole for one year following completion of his or her sentence, unless the court releases the person from parole as part of its resentencing order. The bill declares that nothing in this bill is intended to diminish or abrogate any rights or remedies otherwise available to the petitioner or applicant."
"Existing law establishes the Student Aid Commission as the primary state agency for the administration of state-authorized student financial aid programs available to students attending all segments of postsecondary education. Existing law requires the commission to include 2 members, appointed by the Governor, who are students enrolled in a California postsecondary educational institution.
This bill would instead require the commission to include 4 student members, one from each of the following: the University of California, the California State University, the California Community Colleges, and a California private postsecondary educational institution. The bill would make conforming and nonsubstantive changes.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 69511 of the Education Code proposed by AB 2154 that would become operative if this bill and AB 2154 are both enacted and this bill is enacted last.","This bill amends the Education Code to revise requirements for the Student Aid Commission of the State of California. The Student Aid Commission shall be composed of the following 17 members: one representative from public, proprietary, or nonprofit postsecondary schools located in California; one representative from a California independent college or university; one representative each from the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges; and four student members, one from each of the following postsecondary educational institutions: the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges. A student member who graduates from an institution with no more than six months of his or her term remaining shall be permitted to serve for the remainder of the term."
"The Cigarette and Tobacco Products Licensing Act of 2003 requires the State Board of Equalization to administer a statewide program to license manufacturers, importers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers of cigarettes and tobacco products, and imposes various licensing fees. That act requires a retailer to have a license to engage in the sale of cigarette and tobacco products, and requires a separate license for each retail location. Existing law imposes a fee for each license and provides that the license is valid for a 12-month period. On and after January 1, 2017, existing law requires a license to be renewed annually and imposes a renewal fee.
This bill would require a retailer that adds an additional retail location to renew the license for that location based on a 12-month period beginning in the month the retailer obtained its license for its first retail location. This bill would prohibit any license fee or renewal fee from being prorated.
The Cigarette and Tobacco Products Licensing Act of 2003 requires the moneys collected pursuant to the act to be deposited in the Cigarette and Tobacco Products Compliance Fund, which are available for expenditure, upon appropriation by the Legislature, solely for the purpose of implementing, enforcing, and administering the licensing program under the act. The act requires the board to report to the Legislature no later than January 1, 2019, regarding the adequacy of funding for the licensing program .
This bill would instead require the board to report to the Legislature, Governor, and Department of Finance on or before January 1, 2019, and on and before January 1 annually thereafter.
The Cigarette and Tobacco Products Tax Law imposes a tax on distributors of cigarettes and tobacco products, and authorizes the reimbursement of the State Board of Equalization for expenses incurred in the administration and collection of the tax.
This bill would prohibit, on or after July 1, 2019, the appropriation of revenues derived from the taxes imposed upon the distribution of cigarettes and tobacco products to the board for the purpose of implementing, enforcing, or administering the California Cigarette and Tobacco Products Licensing Act of 2003.","This bill amends the Business and Professions Code, with respect to the sale of cigarettes or tobacco products, to require a retailer to have in place and maintain a license to engage in such sale. A retailer that owns or controls more than one retail location must obtain a separate license for each location, but may submit a single application for those licenses. A license is not assignable or transferable. A person who obtains a license as a retailer who ceases to do business as specified in the license, or who never commenced business, or whose license is suspended or revoked, shall immediately surrender the license to the board.

The bill would require the department to post the manual on its Internet Web site and on its professional development Internet Web site. In developing the manual, the bill would require the department to review manuals and other resources produced on this topic by local educational agencies, special education administrators, other organizations, other states, and the federal government, and to establish and consult with a stakeholder group comprised of specified experts and practitioners. As part of implementing these provisions, the bill would require the department, with input from the stakeholder group, to develop a plan for the dissemination of the manual and the means of providing professional development on the content of the manual, as specified, but would condition the actual implementation of the plan on an appropriation for that purpose in the annual Budget Act or another enacted statute. The bill would require the department to submit the plan to the State Board of Education, the Department of Finance, the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, the Advisory Commission on Special Education, and the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature on or before July 1, 2018. The bill would state the intent of the Legislature that its provisions be funded with federal funds, to the extent permissible.","This bill requires the Department of Education, on or before July 1, 2018, to develop a manual providing guidance to local educational agencies (LEAs), charter schools, and state special schools on identifying, assessing, supporting, and reclassifying English learners who may qualify for special education services and pupils with disabilities who may be classified as English learners.

Existing law, commonly known as the TRUST Act, prohibits a law enforcement official, as defined, from detaining an individual on the basis of a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement hold after that individual becomes eligible for release from custody, unless, at the time that the individual becomes eligible for release from custody, certain conditions are met, including, among other things, that the individual has been convicted of specified crimes. Existing law defines specified terms for purposes of these provisions.

By requiring these local agencies to comply with these requirements, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.

The Personal Income Tax Law, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, allows an earned income credit against personal income tax, which is only for earned income from wages, salaries, tips, and other employee compensation, and a payment in excess of that credit amount, to an eligible individual that is equal to that portion of the earned income tax credit allowed by federal law as determined by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor as set forth in the annual Budget Act.
This bill would, for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016, expand the earned income credit allowed by the Personal Income Tax Law by providing additional conformity with federal income tax law to include specified net earnings from self-employment in earned income thus allowing an earned income credit for taxpayers for those earnings.
Existing law establishes the continuously appropriated Tax Relief and Refund Account and provides that payments required to be made to taxpayers or other persons from the Personal Income Tax Fund are to be paid from that account, including any amount allowable as an earned income credit in excess of any tax liabilities.
By authorizing new payments from that account for additional amounts in excess of personal income tax liabilities, this bill would make an appropriation.
Existing law imposes an annual minimum franchise tax, except as provided, on every corporation incorporated in this state, qualified to transact intrastate business in this state, or doing business in this state. Existing law, until taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, exempts a corporation and a limited liability company that are small businesses solely owned by a deployed member of the United States Armed Forces, as specified, from paying the minimum franchise tax, or the annual tax, for the privilege of doing business in this state if the corporation or limited liability company ceases operation or operates at a loss, as defined.
The bill would reduce the annual minimum franchise tax to $150 for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, for specified corporations. This bill would also extend the exemption for corporations and limited liability companies solely owned by deployed members of the United States Armed Forces until January 1, 2020.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on November 18, 2014. (Sec. 1) This bill amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to allow, beginning on January 1, 2016, a refundable tax credit for earned income that is equal to the amount of the earned income tax credit multiplied by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor for the taxable year. The amount of the credit, relating to earned income, shall be multiplied by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor for the taxable year. Unless otherwise specified in the annual Budget Act, the earned income tax credit adjustment factor for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2015, shall be 0%. The earned income tax credit authorized by this Act shall only be operative for taxable years for which resources are authorized in the annual Budget Act for the Franchise Tax Board to oversee and audit returns associated with the credit."
"Existing law requires every health studio services contract to be in writing and that a copy of the written contract be given to the customer at the time he or she signs the contract.
This bill would, in the alternative, require that the contract be delivered by email to the customer at the time he or she signs the contract.
Existing law requires the contract to include a statement that discloses the length of the term of the contract in at least 14-point type and requires the contract to contain on the first page the name and address of the health studio operator to which a notice of cancellation can be mailed and the date the buyer signed the contract.
This bill would, instead, require the contract to disclose the initial or minimum length of the term of the contract and would, in the alternative, require the contract to be presented in an electronic format that is as equally legible as the printed contract.
Existing law requires the contract to provide a description of the services, facilities, and hours of access that the consumer is entitled to and provides that any services, facilities, and hours of access that are not described in the contract are to be considered optional services and as separate contracts, as specified.
This bill would, in the alternative, require a contract to state where the description of services, facilities, and hours of access that the consumer is entitled to is available on the health studio operator’s Internet Web site and would provide that any services, facilities, and hours of access that are not described in the contract or on the health studio operator’s Internet Web site are to be considered optional services and as separate contracts, as specified.
Existing law authorizes a consumer to cancel a contract for health studio services within specified timeframes after the contract is executed, if the health studio fails to provide the specific facilities advertised or offered or if the health studio eliminates or reduces the scope of the facilities, as specified.
This bill would specify that a contract for health studio services may be canceled by the buyer in person, via email from an email address on file with the health studio, or via first-class mail, and would require that the email address to which a notice of cancellation email is to be sent be on the first page of the contract. The bill would make other conforming changes.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003.

"Existing law requires the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery to develop and adopt requirements relating to adequate areas for collecting, storing, and loading recyclable materials in state buildings. Existing law requires each state agency or large state facility, when entering into a new lease, or renewing an existing lease, to ensure that adequate areas are provided for, and adequate personnel are available to oversee, the collection, storage, and loading of recyclable materials in compliance with those requirements.
This bill would require the department, on or before July 1, 2017, to develop guidance for collecting and recycling recyclable materials in office buildings of state agencies and large state facilities, except buildings and facilities of community college districts or their campuses. The bill would require that a covered state agency and large state facility, on and after July 1, 2018, provide adequate receptacles, signage, education, and staffing, and arrange for recycling services consistent with specified law, for each office building of the state agency or large state facility. The bill would require, at least once per year, a covered state agency and large state facility to review the adequacy and condition of receptacles for recyclable material and of associated signage, education, and staffing.
Existing law requires each state agency to submit an annual report to the department summarizing its progress in reducing solid waste, as specified.
This bill would require that report to include a summary of the state agency’s compliance with this act.
This bill would incorporate additional changes in Section 42926 of the Public Resources Code proposed by AB 2396 that would become operative only if AB 2396 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January 1, 2017, and this bill is chaptered last.","This bill requires the Department of Commerce to develop guidance for state agencies and large state facilities to collect recyclable materials in office buildings and to provide adequate receptacles, signage, education, and staffing. recyclable materials shall include paper, plastic, metal, and organic waste. State agencies and facilities must review the adequacy and condition of receptacles for recyclable materials at least once per year."
"Existing law requires a probation officer, upon delivery of a minor who has been taken into temporary custody, to immediately investigate the circumstances of the minor and the facts surrounding the minor being taken into custody and to immediately release the minor to the custody of his or her parent, legal guardian, or responsible relative unless evidence before the court demonstrates that continuance in the home is contrary to the child’s welfare, and one or more specified circumstances is present, including, among others, that the minor is destitute.
This bill would delete several of those specified circumstances. The bill would also prohibit the probation officer, when deciding whether to detain a minor who is currently a dependent of the juvenile court or the subject of a petition to declare him or her a dependent of the juvenile court and who has been removed from the custody of his or her parent or guardian by the juvenile court, from considering specified information, including, among others, the minor’s status as a dependent of the juvenile court or as the subject of a petition to declare him or her a dependent of the juvenile court. The bill would require a probation officer to immediately release that minor to the custody of the child welfare services department or his or her current foster parent or other caregiver, except as specified. By increasing the duties imposed on local child welfare services departments, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Amends the Welfare and Institutions Code, with respect to temporary custody of minors, to require the probation officer of a minor who has been taken into temporary custody to immediately release the minor to the custody of his or her parent, legal guardian, or responsible relative unless it can be demonstrated before the court that continuance in the home is contrary to the minor's welfare and one or more of the following conditions exist: (1) continued detention of the minor is a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the protection of the minor or reasonable necessity for the protection of the person or property of another; (2) the minor is likely to flee; or (3) the minor has violated an order of the juvenile court.<n><n>Requires the probation officer to: (1) provide oral notification to the minor's relatives who are located, except when such relatives make written notification inappropriate, within 30 days of the minor being detained and being removed from the custody of his or her parent or guardian by the juvenile court; and (2) conduct, within 30 days, an investigation in order to identify and locate all grandparents, adult siblings, and other relatives of the child, including any other adult relatives who are located.<n><n>Increases funding for the foster care and adoption assistance program under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act."
"Existing law requires the county assessor to consider, when valuing real property for property taxation purposes, the effect of any enforceable restrictions to which the use of the land may be subjected, including, but not limited to, zoning, recorded contracts with governmental agencies, and various other restrictions imposed by governments.
This bill would require the county assessor to consider, when valuing real property for property taxation purposes, a contract that is a 99-year ground lease between a community land trust, as defined, and the qualified owner, as defined, of an owner-occupied single-family dwelling or an owner-occupied unit in a multifamily dwelling and that subjects a single-family dwelling or unit in a multifamily dwelling, and the land on which the dwelling or unit is situated that is leased to the qualified owner for the convenient occupation and use of that dwelling or unit, to affordability restrictions, as defined.
By changing the manner in which county assessors assess property for property taxation purposes, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.
This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.","Amends the Revenue and Taxation Code to require the assessor in the assessment of land to consider the effect upon the value of enforceable restrictions to which the use of the land may be subjected, including: (1) zoning; (2) recorded contracts with governmental agencies; (3) permit authority of, and permits issued by, governmental agencies exercising land use powers concurrently with local governments; (4) development controls of a local government in accordance with any local coastal program certified pursuant to Division 20 of the Public Resources Code; (5) development controls of a local government in accordance with a local protection program, or any component thereof; (6) environmental constraints applied to the use of land pursuant to provisions of statutes; (7) hazardous waste land use restriction; and (8) recorded conservation, trail, or scenic easements, including solar-use easements."
"Under existing law, a tenant of real property, for a term less than life, or the executor or administrator or his or her estate, is guilty of unlawful detainer when he or she continues in possession, in person or by subtenant, of the property or any part of the property, after the expiration of the term for which it is let to him or her, except as specified. Under existing law, access to limited civil case records filed in an unlawful detainer action is restricted to (1) parties to the action, (2) certain people who provide the court clerk with specified information about the parties to the action, (3) any person by order of the court on a showing of good cause, and (4) any other person 60 days after the complaint has been filed, unless the defendant prevails in the action within 60 days after the filing of the complaint, in which case access is limited to the other parties allowed access, as described above.
This bill would instead provide that access to limited civil case records filed in an unlawful detainer action is restricted, for purposes of (4), as described above, (1) to any person by order of the court if judgment is entered for the plaintiff after trial more than 60 days since the filing of the complaint, and (2) to any other person 60 days after the complaint has been filed if the plaintiff prevails in the action within 60 days of the filing of the complaint. The bill would provide that if a default or default judgment is set aside more than 60 days after the complaint was filed, the court file access restrictions, as described above, shall apply as if the complaint had been filed on the date the default or the default judgment is set aside. The bill would authorize the court to bar access to court records in the action if the parties so stipulate.
Existing law requires a complaint filed in an unlawful detainer proceeding to include certain information and requires a defendant to answer the complaint, as specified, within 5 days of being served with a summons and the complaint, unless the court orders otherwise for good cause shown. Existing law also requires proof of service of a summons to be filed in a civil action, including in an unlawful detainer proceeding.
This bill would permit a court to dismiss an unlawful detainer proceeding without prejudice if proof of service of the summons has not been filed within 60 days of the complaint’s filing.",Declares that it is the intent of the Legislature to amend existing statutes regarding open access to public records by making permanently unavailable to the public: (1) civil case records in unlawful detainer proceedings in which the plaintiff does not prevail within 60 days of filing instead of unlawful detainer proceedings in which the defendant prevails within 60 days of filing; and (2) to any person by order of the court if judgment is entered for the plaintiff after trial more than 60 days since the filing of the complaint.
"Under existing law, upon the proclamation of a state of emergency resulting from an earthquake, flood, fire, riot, storm, or natural or manmade disaster declared by the President of the United States or the Governor, or upon the declaration of a local emergency resulting from an earthquake, flood, fire, riot, storm, or natural or manmade disaster by the executive officer of any county, city, or city and county, and for a period of 30 days following that declaration, it is a misdemeanor with specified penalties for a person, contractor, business, or other entity to sell or offer to sell certain goods and services for a price that exceeds by 10% the price charged by that person immediately prior to the proclamation of emergency, except as specified.
This bill would revise the definitions of a state of emergency and a local emergency to mean a natural or manmade emergency resulting from an earthquake, flood, fire, riot, storm, drought, plant or animal infestation or disease, or other natural or manmade disaster for which a state of emergency has been declared by the President of the United States or the Governor of California or for which a local emergency has been declared by an official, board, or other governing body vested with authority to make such a declaration in any city, county, or city and county in California, respectively. The bill would include towing services in the provisions described above. The bill would also specify that housing means any rental housing with an initial lease term of no longer than one year for purposes of these provisions. The bill would make other clarifying and conforming changes, including, among others, a specification that these provisions apply to both a state of emergency and a local emergency, and would make certain additional findings by the Legislature. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would create a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","Makes it unlawful, for a person, contractor, business, or other entity, upon the proclamation of a state of emergency or local emergency declared by the President or Governor, or upon the declaration of a local emergency by a governing body, to sell or offer to sell any consumer food items or goods, goods or services used for emergency cleanup, emergency supplies, medical supplies, home heating oil, building materials, housing, transportation, freight, and storage services, or gasoline or other motor fuels for a price of more than ten percent above the price charged by that person for those goods or services immediately before the proclamation or declaration. Makes it unlawful, for a contractor to sell or offer to sell any repair or reconstruction services or any services used in emergency cleanup, for a price of more than ten percent above the price charged by that person for those services immediately before the proclamation or declaration, if that person can prove that the increase was directly attributable to additional costs imposed by the supplier or materials used to provide the services, provided that in those situations where the increase in price is attributable to additional costs for labor or materials used to provide the services, the price represents no more than ten percent above the total cost to the seller plus the markup customarily applied by the seller for that good or service"
"Existing law establishes various housing programs directed by the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), including special housing programs to provide housing assistance for persons with developmental and physical disabilities and persons with mental health disorders. Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions.
This bill would require HCD to, on or before October 1, 2017, establish the Housing for a Healthy California Program and on or before April 1, 2018, and every year thereafter, subject to appropriation by the Legislature, award grants on a competitive basis to eligible grant applicants based on guidelines that HCD would draft, as prescribed, and other requirements. The bill would provide that an applicant is eligible for a grant under the program if the applicant meets specified requirements, including that the applicant identify a source of funding, as specified, agree to contribute funding for interim and long-term rental assistance, and agree to collect and report data, as specified.
The bill would require an applicant awarded a grant to use the funds for specified purposes, including long-term rental assistance and interim housing. The bill would provide that a county resident is eligible to receive assistance pursuant to a grant awarded under the program if he or she meets specified requirements, including that the person is homeless, is a Medi-Cal beneficiary, is eligible for Supplemental Security Income, is eligible to receive certain services, and is likely to improve his or her health with supportive services. The bill would provide that the program shall be funded upon appropriation by the Legislature. The bill would also authorize HCD, for purposes of implementing these provisions, to enter into exclusive or nonexclusive contracts on a bid or negotiated basis, exempt from specified small business procurement, personal service, and public contracting provisions, and exempt from the review or approval of any division of the Department of General Services. The bill would exempt the program guidelines created by the department from requirements prescribed for administrative regulations. The bill would require HCD to analyze data collected pursuant to the program, as specified, and by October 1, 2019, and subsequently as the program may be funded, to report program data to certain legislative committees, as specified. The bill would condition implementation of these provisions upon an appropriation provided for this purpose.",This bill requires the Department of Housing and Community Development to: (1) establish the Housing for a Healthy California Program to award competitive grants to public or nonprofit private housing providers for interim and long-term rental assistance for people experiencing homelessness; (2) award grants on a competitive basis to eligible grant applicants; and (3) contract with an independent or work with an evaluator to analyze data collected pursuant to this bill to determine the ability of the applicants to administer a program offering interim and long-term rental assistance to people experiencing homelessness and the impact of housing costs in the applicant's geographic area.
"Existing law requires an elections official to transmit the semifinal official results to the Secretary of State following commencement of the semifinal official canvass. After the official canvass, existing law requires an elections official to prepare a certified statement of the results of the election and submit it to the governing body. The elections official must also post the certified statement of the results on his or her Internet Web site in a downloadable spreadsheet format that may include a comma-separated values file or a tab-separated values file and that is compatible with a spreadsheet software application that is widely used at the time of the posting. Existing law requires the certified statement of the election results to be posted and maintained on the elections official’s Internet Web site for a period of at least 10 years following the election.
This bill would require a county with the technical capacity to do so to post the information contained in the statement of the results, as well as other available election data, on its Internet Web site beginning on election night and continuing as specified until the election results are certified. This bill would require the county to post this information in downloadable spreadsheet and Election Markup Language (EML) formats, as specified. This bill would also decrease to 22 months the amount of time the certified statement of election results must be posted and maintained on the elections official’s Internet Web site.
This bill would also require a county elections official to propose a modification of its voting system to the Secretary of State
by December 31, 2017,
for approval if modification of that system would enable the county to post required information on its Internet Web site immediately following the election, as specified.
Existing law requires the Secretary of State to certify or conditionally approve a voting system prior to any election at which it is to be used, as specified. Existing law specifically prohibits the Secretary of State from certifying or conditionally approving a voting system that lacks certain features.
This bill would in addition prohibit the Secretary of State from certifying or conditionally approving a voting system after December 31, 2017, that is not capable of generating information contained in the statement of the result in both downloadable spreadsheet and Election Markup Language (EML) formats and enabling data to be transferred from this system to an external digital medium, as specified.
By imposing additional obligations on county elections officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","This bill amends the California Election Code to require county elections officials, following the commencement of the official canvass, to post on their websites: (1) a statement of the results showing the total number of ballots cast, the number of votes cast at each precinct for each candidate and for and against each measure, and the number of votes cast in each city, Assembly district, congressional district, senatorial district, State Board of Equalization district, and supervisorial district located in whole or in the county, for each candidate for the offices of presidential elector and all statewide offices; and (2) data for vote by mail ballots, provisional ballots, spoiled ballots, and any other data readily available on the computer system.

The bill would require a public investment fund to undertake reasonable efforts to obtain the above-mentioned information for any existing contract for which the public investment fund has not made a new capital commitment on or after January 1, 2017. The bill would make a statement of legislative intent. Because this bill would impose new requirements on local entities relating to the collection of information and its presentation at an open meeting, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires each public investment fund to require, at least annually, each alternative investment vehicle (i.e., a private equity fund, venture fund, hedge fund, or absolute return fund) in which it invests to make disclosures including: the fees and expenses that the fund pays directly to the vehicle; the public investment fund's (other than a person's) 10% share of fees and expenses that are paid from the vehicle to the fund manager or related parties; the public investment fund's consulting, legal, or other consultant share of aggregate fees and expenses paid by all of the portfolio companies held within the vehicle to the fund manager or related parties; and the public investment fund's pro rata share of aggregate fees and expenses paid by all of the portfolio companies to the fund manager or related parties.

"Existing law sets forth the courses a pupil is required to complete while in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school. The governing board of a school district is required to adopt alternative means for pupils to complete the prescribed course of study for high school graduation. Those alternative means may include, among other things, career technical education classes offered in high schools and courses offered by regional occupational centers or programs.
This bill would authorize those alternative means to include online advanced placement courses that are approved by the College Board. The bill would also authorize a school district to contract with a provider of the approved online advanced placement courses to provide the courses free of charge to its pupils.
Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary education in this state. Under this system, local educational agencies are authorized to operate public schools and provide instruction to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive.

This bill would prohibit the term of imprisonment for nonpayment of a fine from exceeding one day for each $125 of the base fine or the term for which the defendant may be sentenced. The bill would require the penalties and assessments imposed on the base fine, if an amount of the base fine is not satisfied by jail credits or community service, to be reduced by the percentage of the base fine that was satisfied.
Existing law also requires that in all felony and misdemeanor convictions, when the defendant has been in custody, that all days of custody of the defendant, as specified, are to be credited upon his or her term of imprisonment, or credited to any fine, on a proportional basis, that may be imposed, at the rate of not less than $125 per day, in the discretion of the court imposing the sentence.
This bill would specify that the rate of credit under those provisions be credited to the term of imprisonment of the defendant or credited to the base fine that may be imposed.

The act excepts from public inspection the home addresses and home telephone numbers of state employees and employees of a school district or county office of education, provided that disclosure can be made in specified instances, including to an employee organization.
This bill would, with certain exceptions, extend the limitation on the disclosure of the personal information described above to all employees of a public agency and would extend the limitation to include personal cellular telephone numbers and birth dates. By increasing the duties of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law additionally excepts from public inspection specified information regarding persons paid by the state to provide in-home supportive services. Existing law requires copies of names, addresses, and telephone numbers of those persons to be made available, upon request, to an exclusive bargaining agent and to any labor organization seeking representation rights, as specified.
This bill would additionally require personal cellular telephone numbers of those persons to be made available to an exclusive bargaining agent and to any labor organization seeking representation rights.

Existing law, the Safe Place to Learn Act, requires the State Department of Education, as part of its regular monitoring and review of a local educational agency, to assess whether the local educational agency has, among other things, adopted a policy that prohibits discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying, as specified, and has publicized that policy to pupils, parents, employees, agents of the governing board, and the general public.
Existing law also requires the department to assess whether the local educational agency has provided to certificated schoolsite employees who serve pupils in any of grades 7 to 12, inclusive, information on existing schoolsite and community resources related to the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning pupils, as specified.
This bill would express legislative findings and declarations relating to pupils who are subject to verbal, physical, and online harassment. The bill would add the support of pupils who face bias or bullying on the basis of religious affiliation, or perceived religious affiliation.

"(1) The California Public Records Act requires a public agency, defined to mean any state or local agency, to make its public records available for public inspection and to make copies available upon request and payment of a fee, unless the public records are exempt from disclosure. The act prohibits limitations on access to a public record based upon the purpose for which the public record is being requested if the public record is otherwise subject to disclosure, authorizes public agencies to adopt requirements that allow for faster, more efficient, or greater access to public records, and requires local agencies, except school districts, that voluntarily post public records on an open data Internet Resource, as defined, to post those public records in an open format that meets specified criteria.
This bill would authorize a public agency that posts a public record on its Internet Web site to refer a member of the public that requests to inspect the public record to the public agency’s Internet Web site where the public record is posted.

The California Constitution authorizes the Legislature to amend an initiative statute by another statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors.
This bill would amend that initiative statute by making the theft of a firearm grand theft in all cases and punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months, or 2 or 3 years.
(2) Under existing law, a person who buys or receives property that has been stolen, knowing the property to be stolen, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding property from the owner, knowing the property to be stolen, is guilty of a misdemeanor or a felony, except that if the value of the property does not exceed $950, Proposition 47 makes the offense punishable as a misdemeanor if the defendant has not previously been convicted of one or more specified serious or violent felonies or

(Sec. 2) The bill amends the state criminal code to revise the definition of &quot; grand theft&quot; to prohibit obtaining property by theft where the value of the money, labor, real property, or personal property taken does not exceed nine hundred dollars ($950) petty theft, with exceptions. This prohibition does not apply to a theft that may be charged as an infraction pursuant to any other law. If the property taken is a firearm, the theft is grand theft in all cases. The bill defines &quot;firearm&quot; as a handgun that has a value of less than $950 and is stolen or obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, or who knows the property to be so stolen or obtained and knowingly sells, conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing,"

The bill would also require any solicitation document produced by a charity to also include the address for the Attorney General’s Internet Web site.
As a violation of these requirements would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
This bill would authorize the Attorney General to enforce these requirements by directing the Franchise Tax Board to suspend or revoke a violating charity’s tax-exempt status, by suspending or revoking the registration of a violating charity, or by taking any other enforcement action pursuant to the Attorney General’s existing powers and duties, as specified.

"Existing law establishes certain criteria that must be met by a manufacturer of an autonomous
vehicle
vehicle, as defined,
in order for
the manufacturer
an eligible driver, as specified,
to operate the autonomous vehicle for testing purposes on public roads.
Existing law requires the driver to be seated in the driver’s seat, monitoring the safe operation of the autonomous vehicle, and capable of taking over immediate manual control of the autonomous vehicle in the event of an autonomous technology failure or other emergency. Existing law requires, as part of an application by the manufacturer to the Department of Motor Vehicles, a certification that the autonomous vehicle allows the operator, as defined, to take control in multiple manners, including, without limitation, through the use of the brake, the accelerator pedal, or the steering wheel, as specified, and a certification that the autonomous vehicle’s autonomous technology meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Existing law provides that federal regulations promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shall supersede these provisions when found to be in conflict with any other state law or regulation.
This bill would, notwithstanding those provisions, until January 1, 2018, require the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Department of the California Highway Patrol to conduct a pilot project in conjunction with one or more manufacturers of autonomous vehicles to test the safety and feasibility of operating autonomous vehicles on public roads. The bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to select 3 counties in which to conduct the pilot project and to contract with local law enforcement agencies to participate in the pilot project in each county. The bill would require the Department of Motor Vehicles to report the results of the pilot project to the Legislature on or before July 1, 2018.

The bill would require the department to adopt conforming regulations no later than July 1, 2018. The bill would require the department to submit a report on the results of the testing and operation of these autonomous vehicles to the Legislature, as specified.","This bill allows an autonomous vehicle to be operated on public roads in California solely by a driver who possesses the proper class of license for the type of vehicle being operated, except until the manufacturer submits an application to the Department of Motor Vehicles and that application is approved by the department. The bill sets forth requirements for the autonomous vehicle, including that: the driver shall be seated in the driver's seat, monitoring the interior of the vehicle, and capable of taking over immediate manual control in the event of an autonomous technology failure or other emergency; the manufacturer shall obtain an instrument of insurance, surety bond, or proof of self-insurance in the amount of five million dollars $5 million; and the vehicle shall have a separate mechanism to capture and store sensor data for at least 30 seconds before a collision occurs between the autonomous vehicle and another vehicle object, including the brake, accelerator pedal, or the steering wheel, and it shall alert the operator that the autonomous technology has been disengaged."
"Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to determine appropriate targets, if any, for each load-serving entity to procure viable and cost-effective energy storage systems to be achieved by December 31, 2020.
This bill would require the PUC, in consultation with the State Air Resources Board and the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, to direct the state’s 3 largest electrical corporations to file applications for programs and investments to accelerate widespread deployment of distributed energy storage systems, as defined. The bill would authorize the PUC to approve, or modify and approve, programs and investments in distributed energy storage systems, as provided, and would require the PUC to prioritize those programs and investments that provide distributed energy storage systems to public sector and low-income customers. Because a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the PUC implementing these requirements would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","This bill requires the Public Utilities Commission to direct California's three largest electrical corporations to file applications for programs and investments to accelerate widespread deployment of distributed energy storage systems to achieve ratepayer benefits, reduce dependence on petroleum, meet ambient air quality standards, and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.

The bill allows the commission to approve or modify and approve programs and investments of an electrical corporation in distributed energy storage systems with appropriate energy storage management systems and reasonable mechanisms for cost recovery, if they are consistent with this bill and do not unreasonably limit or impair the ability of nonutility enterprises to market and deploy energy storage systems. The total capacity of the programs and investments in distributed energy storage systems approved by the commission shall not exceed 500 megawatts, divided equally among the state's three largest electrical corporations."
"The Construction-Related Accessibility Standards Compliance Act establishes standards for making new construction and existing facilities accessible to persons with disabilities, including inspections by private persons or building inspectors who are certified access specialists (CASps), and provides for construction-related accessibility claims for violations of those standards. That act requires a local agency, commencing January 1, 2014, to employ or retain a sufficient number of building inspectors who are CASps to conduct permitting and plan check services to review for compliance with state construction-related accessibility standards by a place of public accommodation with respect to new construction. The act requires, if a local agency employs or retains 2 or more CASps, that at least
half
one-half
of the CASps be building inspectors who are CASps.
This bill would require, commencing January 1, 2021, that all building inspectors employed or retained by a local agency who conduct permitting and plan check services to review for compliance with state construction-related accessibility standards by a place of public accommodation with respect to new construction or renovations, including, but not limited to, projects relating to tenant improvements that may impact access, be CASps. The bill would also require all new employees employed or retained by a local agency on or after January 1, 2018, and who will conduct permitting and plan check services to review for compliance with state construction-related accessibility standards by a place of public accommodation, to be CASps within
24

Until December 31, 2018, existing law requires any applicant for a local business license or equivalent instrument or permit, or renewal of a local business license or equivalent instrument or permit, to pay an additional state fee of $1 for that license, instrument, or permit. Under existing law, the city, county, or city and county that collected the fee retains 70% of the fee, and the remaining 30% of the fee is deposited into the Disability Access and Education Revolving Fund, a continuously appropriated fund.
This bill, from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019, would increase that state fee to $4 and would require any applicant for a building permit in a city, county, or city and county that does not issue business licenses or an equivalent instrument or permit to pay an additional fee of $4 for that building permit. Beginning January 1, 2020, those fees would be reduced to $1. The bill, from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019, would increase the percentage of the fee retained by a local agency to 90% and the remaining 10% would be deposited into the Disability Access and Education Revolving Fund. Beginning January 1, 2020, those percentages would revert to 70% and 30%, respectively. By increasing revenue to a continuously appropriated fund, increasing the fee, extending the period of time during which the fee will be collected, and imposing an additional fee, this bill would make an appropriation. The bill would make an appropriation by authorizing local government entities to retain an increased percentage of the increased fee. The bill would require that the moneys retained by a local agency be placed in a special fund established by the local agency, to be known as the “CASp Certification and Training Fund.” The bill would require that fees collected in a CASp Certification and Training Fund be used for increased certified access specialist training and certification in the local jurisdiction, thereby making an appropriation by expanding the purposes for which the retained fee moneys are required to be spent.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 19, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Under existing law, contracts by state agencies for services rendered to the state are, with certain exceptions, of no effect unless and until approved by the Department of General Services. Existing law imposes various requirements with respect to contracts for services rendered to the state. Existing law requires the department to develop factors for state agencies to consider in deciding whether to sell or license their intellectual property.
This bill would, for contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2017, require a state agency entering into a contract for services to consider the intellectual property rights of both the state and the contracting party unless the agency, prior to execution of the contract, obtains the consent of the department.

Declares that, in exercising its authority with respect to contracts for the services of legal counsel, other than the Attorney General, the department, as a condition of approval of the contract, shall require the State agency to demonstrate that the consent of the Attorney General to the employment of the other counsel has been granted pursuant to the Government Code."
"Existing law establishes a workers’ compensation system, administered by the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers’ Compensation, within the Department of Industrial Relations, to compensate an employee for injuries sustained in the course of his or her employment.
Existing law defines an employee, for purposes of the laws governing workers’ compensation, to include, among other persons, officers and members of boards of directors of quasi-public or private corporations while rendering actual service for the corporations for pay. Existing law excludes from that definition, among other persons, officers and directors of a private corporation who are the sole shareholders of the corporation and working members of a partnership or limited liability company, as specified, unless they elect to come under the compensation provisions of the laws governing workers’ compensation.
This bill would revise those exceptions from the definition of an employee to apply to an officer or member of the board of directors, as specified, if he or she owns at least 15% of the issued and outstanding stock of the corporation, or an individual who is a general partner of a partnership or a managing member of a limited liability company, and that person elects to be excluded by executing a written waiver of his or her rights under the laws governing workers’ compensation, stating under penalty of perjury that he or she is a qualifying officer or director, or a qualifying general partner or managing member, as applicable. The bill would specify the effective date of the waivers.
The bill would also make technical and clarifying changes to the provision excluding specified persons from the definition of employee.
The bill would also delete obsolete provisions.
Existing law proscribes the crime of perjury.
By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

Existing law generally requires, upon the filing of a claim for disability benefits, the Employment Development Department to promptly make a computation on the claim setting forth the maximum amount of benefits potentially payable during the disability benefit period and the weekly benefit amount and to promptly notify the claimant of the computation. Existing law allows the claimant to, within 20 days after the mailing or personal service of the notice of computation or recomputation, protest the accuracy of the computation or recomputation, requires the department to consider any protest and notify the claimant of the recomputation or denial of recomputation, and allows the claimant to appeal to an administrative law judge within 20 days from mailing or personal service of the notice of denial of recomputation, which may be extended for good cause.

The bill would also, commencing March 1, 2018, extend the appeal period to the appeals board to within 30 days from the date of notification or mailing of the administrative law judge’s decision.","This bill amends the Unemployment Insurance Code, with respect to determining a claimant's eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits, to require the Department of Labor to: (1) consider the facts submitted by the employer, and (2) determine the claimant's eligibility for benefits. The claimant may appeal therefrom to an administrative law judge within 20 days from mailing or personal service of the notice of determination. The claimant may also appeal therefrom to an administrative law judge within 30 days from mailing or personal service of the notice of determination. The decision shall be final unless, within 30 days after mailing of the decision, further appeal is initiated to an administrative law judge within 30 days from mailing or personal service of the applicable notice."
"Existing law, the Carpenter-Presley-Tanner Hazardous Substance Account Act (California Superfund Act), imposes liability for hazardous substance removal or remedial actions and authorizes moneys in the Toxic Substances Control Account in the General Fund to be expended by the Department of Toxic Substances Control to pay, among other things, all costs of removal or remedial actions incurred by the state and for the state’s share of the costs of removal or remedial actions mandated by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, commonly known as the Federal Superfund Act. Existing law expresses the intent of the Legislature that the funds deposited in the account be appropriated in the annual Budget Act each year in a specified manner, including not less than $6,750,000 to the Site Remediation Account in the General Fund for direct site remediation costs, as defined. Existing law defines orphan sites as those with no reasonably identifiable responsible parties.
This bill would instead express the intent of the Legislature that the funds deposited in the account be appropriated in the annual Budget Act each year to the Site Remediation Account in an amount that is sufficient to pay for estimated costs for direct site remediation at both federal Superfund orphan sites and at state orphan sites, and that not less than $10,750,000 be appropriated in the annual Budget Act each year to the Site Remediation Account for direct site remediation costs. The bill would require the department to include those estimated costs in a report submitted to the Legislature with the Governor’s Budget each year.
Existing law requires the department to provide the State Board of Equalization with a schedule of codes identifying the types of organizations that use, generate, store, or conduct activities in this state related to hazardous materials. Each organization type identified in the schedule is required to pay an annual fee, which is deposited in the Toxic Substances Control Account. Existing law expresses the intent that those organization fee rates are intended to provide sufficient revenue to fund, among other things, appropriations in any given fiscal year of $3,300,000 to fund the state’s clean-up obligation under the Federal Superfund Act. If the department determines that the state’s obligation under the Federal Superfund Act will exceed $3,300,000 in any fiscal year, existing law requires the department to report that determination to the Legislature in the Governor’s Budget.
This bill would repeal that expression of legislative intent and a related requirement that the Legislature specify in the annual Budget Act changes to those rates necessary to fund the state’s increased obligation under the Federal Superfund Act. The bill would instead express the intent of the Legislature that those rates are intended to provide sufficient revenue to fund appropriations in any given fiscal year to fund the state’s obligation under the Federal Superfund Act.
This bill would also make conforming changes and delete obsolete provisions.","Amends the Health and Safety Code to revise requirements for the allocation of funds deposited in the Toxic Substances Control Account (TSCA). Specifies amounts that shall be appropriated in the annual Budget Act each year in: (1) an amount sufficient to pay for the estimated costs identified by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a specified report to the Legislature for direct site remediation costs; (2) not less than ten million seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($10,75 to the Site Remediation Account in the General Fund) for direct site remediation costs; (3) not less than four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) to the Expedited Site Remediation Trust Fund in the State Treasury, for purposes of paying the orphan share of response costs; (4) an amount that does not exceed the costs incurred by the State Board of Equalization, a private party, or other public agency, to administer and collect the fees imposed pursuant to this Act and deposited into the TSCA, for the purpose of reimbursing the State Board of Equalization, public agency, or private party for those costs; and (5) not less than one million dollars ($1,050,000) for purposes of establishing and implementing a program to encourage hazardous waste generators to implement pollution prevention measures. Authorizes funds not appropriated as specified to be appropriated for"
"(1) The Hazardous Waste Control Law authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control and authorized local enforcement officers and agencies to require specified persons to furnish and transmit certain information relating to the person’s ability to pay for or perform a response action, and further authorizes those entities to require any person who has information regarding another person’s activities that relate to the ability of the person to pay for or perform a response action to also furnish and transmit the information. Existing law makes those provisions applicable only if there is a reasonable basis to believe that there has been or may be a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance and only for the purpose of determining how to finance a response action or otherwise for the purpose of enforcing the Hazardous Waste Control Law. A violation of the Hazardous Waste Control Law is a crime.
This bill would make those provisions applicable also if there is a reasonable basis to believe that there has been or may be a release or threatened release of hazardous wastes or hazardous material and also for the purpose of determining how to finance a corrective action.
(2) Existing law authorizes an officer or employee of the department and specified other persons to require any person who has or may have information relevant to specified matters relating to the release of hazardous substances to furnish and transmit that information. Existing law authorizes the department to disclose trade secrets received by the department pursuant to the Hazardous Waste Control Law only under specified circumstances.
This bill would require the person required to furnish and transmit the information to pay for any costs of photocopying and transmitting the information. The bill would limit the disclosure by the department of information, including trade secrets, received by the department pursuant to these provisions of the Hazardous Waste Control Law, specifying the parties to whom that disclosure is proper and requiring the disclosures be in connection with the department’s responsibilities under that law. The bill would require this information to be made available to governmental agencies for use in making studies and for use in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the information. The bill would make conforming and other nonsubstantive changes. Because the bill’s provisions would expand the scope of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Health and Safety Code to authorize the Department of Environmental Protection, in connection with any action authorized by such Code, to require the following persons to furnish and transmit, upon reasonable notice, to its designated offices any existing information relating to hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, or hazardous materials: (1) any person who owns or operates any hazardous waste facility; (2) any person who generates, stores, treats, transports, disposes of, or otherwise handles hazardous waste; (3) any person who arranges, or has arranged, contract or other agreement to store, treat, transport, dispose of, or otherwise handle hazardous waste; and (4) any person who applies, or has applied, for any permit, registration, or certification under such Code. Applies such requirement only if there is a reasonable basis to believe that there has been or may be a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance, hazardous wastes, or hazardous material, and only for the purpose of determining how to finance a response or corrective action or otherwise for the purpose of enforcing this Act. Authorizes the Department to require the following persons to furnish and transmit, upon reasonable notice,"
"Under existing law, any employer or other person acting either individually or as an officer, agent, or employee of another person, who pays or causes to be paid to any employee a wage less than the minimum fixed by applicable state or local law or an order of the Industrial Welfare Commission, is subject to a civil penalty, restitution of wages, liquidated damages payable to the employee, and any applicable specified penalties, as provided. Existing law provides notice and hearing requirements under which a person against whom a citation has been issued can request a hearing to contest proposed assessment of a civil penalty, wages, liquidated damages, and any applicable penalties. Existing law further provides that after a hearing with the Labor Commissioner, a person contesting a citation may file a writ of mandate, within 45 days, with the appropriate superior court.
This bill would require a person seeking a writ of mandate contesting the Labor Commissioner’s ruling to post a bond with the Labor Commissioner, as specified, in an amount equal to the unpaid wages assessed under the citation, excluding penalties. The bill would require that the bond be issued in favor of the unpaid employees and ensure that the person seeking the writ makes prescribed payments pursuant to the proceedings. The bill would provide that the proceeds of the bond, sufficient to cover the amount owed, would be forfeited to the employee if the employer fails to pay the amounts owed within 10 days from the conclusion of the proceedings, as specified.","(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003.

"Existing law requires the Director of the Department of General Services and the directors of other state agencies to establish goals for the participation of small businesses, including microbusinesses, in the provision of goods, information technology, and services to the state, and in the construction of state facilities.
This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to set and implement a 25% small business participation goal for state procurement and contracting.
Existing law requires each state agency that was awarded any contract financed with the proceeds of the infrastructure-related bond acts of 2006 in the previous fiscal year to report to the Director of General Services statistics comparing the small business and microbusiness participation dollars for contracts funded by these bonds to the total contract dollars for contracts funded by the bonds.
This bill would require that the goals established by the agency director for the participation of small businesses, as described above, be reported to the director in that report.
Existing law requires the department to make available a report on contracting that contains information on the level of participation by small businesses in state contracting.
The bill would also require the goals established by the director for the participation of small businesses, as described above, to be included in that report. The bill would also
require that,
require,
to the extent feasible, beginning
in 2018,
with the report issued in 2018 covering contracting activity in the 2017–18 fiscal year,
that specified information in the report about the participation of small businesses be provided by prime contractor and subcontractor, separately. The bill would define subcontractor and prime contractor for purposes of these provisions.
The bill would also revise the categories, defined by the number of employees, by which a statistical summary relating to small and microbusinesses is required to be reported, and, to the extent feasible, beginning with the report issued in 2018 covering contracting activity in the 2017–18 fiscal year, the number of contracts awarded by the department in those categories.","(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on March 16, 2013. (Sec. 1) Declares the intent of the state of California to set and implement a 25% small business participation goal for state procurement and contracting. (Sec. 2) Amends the Public Contract Code to require the directors of the state agencies that enter state contracts, in order to facilitate the participation of small businesses (including microbusiness bidders) in the provision of goods, information technology, and services to the state and in construction facilities, to: (1) establish goals for the extent of small business participation; (2) provide preference (up to a maximum of 5%) to the highest responsible bidder for contracts for goods, information technology, services, and construction where an award is to be made to the highest bidder based on price and other specified factors; (3) provide preference (up to a maximum of 5%) to nonsmall business bidders that provide for small business and microbusiness participation; and (4) give special consideration to microbusiness bidders and give special assistance to them in the preparation and submission of information requested."
"Existing federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, provides for the negotiation and execution of tribal-state gaming compacts for the purpose of authorizing certain types of gaming on Indian lands within a state. The California Constitution authorizes the Governor to negotiate and conclude compacts, subject to ratification by the Legislature. Existing law expressly ratifies a number of tribal-state gaming compacts, and amendments of tribal-state gaming compacts, between the State of California and specified Indian tribes.
Existing law establishes the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund within the State Treasury for the receipt and deposit of moneys derived from gaming device license fees that are received from tribes pursuant to the terms of tribal-state gaming compacts for the purpose of making distributions to noncompact tribes. Existing law provides that moneys in that fund are available to the California Gambling Control Commission, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the purpose of making those distributions in accordance with plans specified in tribal-state gaming compacts.
This bill would clarify that the purpose of the fund is for making distributions to eligible recipient Indian tribes.
Existing law requires the California Gambling Control Commission to, on or before the day of the May budget revision for each fiscal year, determine the anticipated total amount of shortfalls in payment likely to occur in the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund for the next fiscal year, and to provide to the committee in the Senate and Assembly that considers the State Budget an estimate of the amount needed to transfer from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to backfill the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund for the next fiscal year. Existing law requires, at the end of each fiscal quarter, the commission’s Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund report to include specified information, including, among other things, the amount paid into the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund by each of the tribes pursuant to the applicable sections of the tribal-state gaming compact.
This bill would provide that tribes contributing to the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund on a net win or gross gaming revenue basis may be aggregated in the quarterly report described above.
Existing law requires the California Gambling Control Commission to determine the amount of money needed to be transferred from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund to ensure that each eligible recipient Indian tribe receives a specified amount of the funds. Existing law defines “eligible recipient tribe” for those purposes to mean a noncompact tribe, as defined in the tribal-state gaming compacts ratified and in effect, as specified. Those compacts define “noncompact tribe” to mean a federally recognized tribe that operates fewer than 350 gaming devices.
This bill would clarify that “eligible recipient Indian tribe” means a noncompact, nongaming, or limited-gaming tribe, as defined in the tribal-state gaming compacts ratified and in effect, as provided. The bill would delete other related, obsolete provisions.","This bill creates in the Treasury an Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund for the receipt and deposit of moneys received by the state from Indian tribes pursuant to the terms of tribal-state gaming compacts for the purpose of making distributions to eligible recipient Indian tribes. Moneys in such Fund shall be available to the California Gambling Control Commission, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the purpose of making distributions to eligible recipient Indian tribes, in accordance with distribution plans specified in tribal-state gaming compacts. The anticipated total amount of shortfalls in the Fund for the next fiscal year shall be determined by the Gambling Control Commission: (1) on or before the day of the May budget revision for each fiscal year, the Commission shall determine the anticipated total amount of shortfalls in payment likely to occur in the Fund for the next fiscal year; and (2) to provide to the committee in the Senate and Assembly that considers the State Budget an estimate of the amount needed to transfer from the Fund to backfill the Fund for the next fiscal year. The anticipated total amount of shortfalls to be transferred from such Fund to the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund shall be determined by the Commission as follows: the anticipated number of eligible recipient Indian tribes that will be eligible to receive payments for the next fiscal year, multiplied by one million"
